       "'\\nBHAGAVAD-GITA in ENGLISH\\nAuthor: Sage Veda Vyasa\\nTranslated in English: Ramananda Prasad, Ph.D.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nThe Bhagavad-Gita is a doctrine of universal truth and a book \\nof moral and spiritual growth. Its message is sublime and non-sectarian. It deals with the most sacred metaphysical science. It imparts the knowledge of the Self and answers two universal questions: Who am I, and how can I lead a happy and peaceful life in \\nthis word full of dualities and dilemmas?\\nIt\\'s a timeless book of wisdom that inspired Thoreau, Emerson, \\nEinstein, Oppenheimer, Gandhi and many others. The BhagavadGita teaches us how to equip ourselves for the battle of life. A repeated study with faith purifies our psyche and guides us to face \\nthe challenges of modern living leading to inner peace and happiness.\\nGita teaches the spiritual science of Self-realization (SR) based \\non the essence of Upanishads and Vedanta. The prime message \\nof the Gita is: The ultimate purpose of life is to realize one’s essential nature and become one with the Supreme Self within all of us. \\nIt assures spiritual progress for all humans, and how to be one with \\nthe Supreme. Its teachings are profound, universal, uplifting, and \\nsublime. \\nThe ignorance of metaphysical or Spiritual knowledge—not \\nknowing our real identity—is humanity’s greatest predicament. It is \\nsaid that there is no human mind that cannot be purified by a repeated study of the Gita. Gita explains the basic principles of spiritual science— using Sanskrit poetry— in a very clear and inspiring \\nmanner. Sacred relationship between the Creator and the creation\\nis well established in the Gita. If one lives in the spirit of even a few \\nverses of the Gita, one’s life will be transformed into divinity. \\nThe philosophy of duty, devotion and Self-knowledge is wonderfully synthesized and harmonized in the Gita—without creating \\nany conflict among them—to give the reader eternal bliss, everlasting peace and perennial joy in life. It awakens Cosmic Consciousness and stimulates life with spirituality. Religion tends to create a \\nwall of division and conflicts along religious lines. Whereas, spirituality unites people by breaking those walls. A spiritual person is a \\nfriend of all and a foe of none, because he considers all creatures—living or non-living—as part and parcel of the Cosmic body \\nof the Absolute, the Source.\\nThe message of the Gita came to humanity due to Arjuna’s \\nunwillingness to do his duty as a warrior, because fighting involved \\ndestruction and killing. Nonviolence or Ahinsa is one of the most \\nfundamental tenets of spiritual culture. All lives, human or non-human, are sacred. This immortal discourse between the Supreme \\nLord, Krishna, and His devotee-friend, Arjuna, occurs not in a temple, a secluded forest, or on a mountain top; but on a battlefield on \\nthe eve of a big war. Anyone can be helped by practice of only a few of \\nits teachings. No change of one’s faith or life-style is needed!\\nA total of seven hundred (700) verses of the Gita, in 18 chapters, are recorded in world’s longest epic, Mahabharata, having \\nover 100,000 verses in Sanskrit poetry. In Gita Lord Krishna advises Arjuna to get up and fight. This may create a misunderstanding of the principles of non-violence if the background of the war of \\nMahabharata is not kept in mind. Therefore, a brief historical description is in order.\\nIn ancient times there was a king who had two sons, Dhritarashtra and Pandu. The former was born blind; therefore, Pandu \\ninherited the kingdom. Pandu had five sons. They were called the \\nPandavas. Dhritarashtra had one hundred sons. They were called \\nthe Kauravas. Duryodhana was the eldest of the Kauravas. \\nAfter the death of king Pandu, the eldest son of Pandu became \\nthe lawful King. Duryodhana was a very jealous person. He also \\nwanted the kingdom. The kingdom was divided into two halves between the Pandavas and the Kauravas. Duryodhana was not satisfied with his share of the kingdom. He wanted the entire kingdom \\nfor himself. He unsuccessfully planned several foul plays to kill the \\nPandavas and take away their kingdom also. He unlawfully took \\npossession of the entire kingdom of the Pandavas and refused to \\ngive back even an acre of land without a war. All mediation by Lord \\nKrishna and others failed. The big war of Mahabharata was thus \\ninevitable. The Pandavas were unwilling participants. They had \\n\\n\\nonly two choices: Fight for their right as a matter of duty or run \\naway from war and accept defeat for the sake of peace and nonviolence. Arjuna, one of the five Pandava brothers, faced this dilemma in the battlefield: \\n\\nWhether to fight or run away from war for \\npeace.\\nArjuna’s dilemma is, in reality, the Universal Dilemma. All human beings face dilemmas, big or small, in their everyday life while\\nperforming their duties. Arjuna’s dilemma was a big one. He had to \\nmake a choice between fighting the war and killing his \\n\\nmost \\nrevered guru who was on the other side, very dear friends, close \\nrelatives, and many innocent warriors; or running away from the \\n\\nbattlefield for the sake of preserving peace and nonviolence. The \\nentire seven hundred verses of the Bhagavad-Gita are a discourse \\nbetween Lord Krishna and the confused Arjuna on the battlefield \\nnear New Delhi, India, in 3,139 BCE. This discourse was narrated\\nto the blind king, Dhritarashtra, by his charioteer, Sanjaya, as an \\neyewitness war report.\\nThe word ‘Bhagavad’ means the Supreme Being, God or Bhagavan in Sanskrit. ‘Gita’ means song. Thus, Bhagavad-Gita means \\nthe Song of God or The Celestial Song, because it was sung by \\nBhagavan Lord Krishna, an incarnation of God Himself. \\nCHAPTER 1\\n1. Arjuna’s Dilemma\\nThe blind King inquired from his charioteer: O Sanjaya, tell me \\nin detail, what did my sons and the Pandavas do in the battlefield \\nbefore the war started? (1.01)\\nChapter Summary\\nSanjaya said: Arjuna asked his charioteer-friend, Lord Krishna, \\nto drive his chariot between the two armies so that he could see \\nthe armies on both sides. Arjuna felt great compassion to see his \\nfriends and relatives on the opposite side, whom he must kill to win \\nthis war. He became confused, spoke of the evils of war, and refused to fight or do his duty as a warrior. \\nArjuna sat down on the back seat of the chariot with his mind \\noverwhelmed with sorrow. (Verse 1.47)\\nNOTE: Some non-essential verses from Chapters 1 and 2 only \\nhave been omitted for ease of understanding the teachings of the \\nGita by the first time readers.\\nCHAPTER 2\\n2. Spiritual knowledge\\nSanjaya said: Lord Krishna spoke these words to Arjuna whose \\neyes were tearful and downcast, and who was overwhelmed with \\ncompassion and despair. (2.01) O King, Lord Krishna, as if smiling, \\nspoke these words to distressed Arjuna in the midst of the two armies. (2.10) \\nTeachings of the Gita begins \\nImportant verses are highlighted. First time readers should \\nread and understand these verses first.\\nThe Supreme Lord said: You grieve for those who are not worthy of grief; and yet speak words of wisdom. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead. (2.11) There was never a time \\nwhen these monarchs, you, or I did not exist, nor shall we ever \\ncease to exist in the future. (2.12) Just as a living being acquires a \\nchildhood body, a youth body, and an old-age body during this life; \\nsimilarly, it acquires another new body after death. The wise are \\nnot deluded by this. (2.13) The contacts of the senses with the \\nsense objects give rise to the feelings of heat and cold, pain and \\npleasure. They are transitory and impermanent. Therefore, learn \\nto endure them, O Arjuna, (2.14) because a calm person — who is \\nnot afflicted by these sense objects, and is steady in pain and \\npleasure — becomes fit for immortality, O Arjuna. (2.15) \\nThe spirit is eternal, body is transitory\\nThe invisible Spirit is eternal, and the visible world, including \\nthe physical body, is transitory. The reality of these two is indeed \\ncertainly seen by the seers of Truth. (2.16) The Spirit by which all \\nthis universe is pervaded is indestructible. No one can destroy the \\nimperishable Spirit. (2.17) Bodies of the eternal, immutable, and \\nincomprehensible Spirit are perishable. Therefore, fight, O Arjuna. \\n(2.18) One who thinks that Spirit is a slayer, and one who thinks \\nSpirit is slain, are both ignorant. Because Spirit neither slays nor is \\nslain. (2.19) The Spirit is neither born nor does it die at any time. It \\ndoes not come into being, or cease to exist. It is unborn, eternal, \\npermanent, and primeval. The Spirit is not destroyed when the \\nbody is destroyed. (2.20) O Arjuna, how can a person who knows \\nthat the Spirit is indestructible, eternal, unborn, and immutable, kill \\nanyone or cause anyone to be killed? (2.21)\\nDeath and Reincarnation of the soul\\nJust as a person puts on new garments after discarding the old \\nones; similarly, the living entity acquires new bodies after casting \\naway the old bodies. (2.22) Weapons do not cut this Spirit, fire \\ndoes not burn it, water does not make it wet, and the wind does not \\nmake it dry. Spirit cannot be cut, burned, wet, or dried. It is eternal, \\n\\n\\nall-pervading, unchanging, immovable, and primeval. (2.23-24) \\nThe Spirit is said to be unexplainable, incomprehensible, and unchanging. Knowing this Spirit as such, you should not grieve. (2.25)\\nEven if you think that this living being takes birth and dies perpetually, even then, O Arjuna, you should not grieve like this. Because, death is certain for one who is born, and birth is certain for \\none who dies; and the cycle of birth-death continues. Therefore, \\nyou should not lament over the inevitable. (2.26-27) All beings, O \\nArjuna, are unmanifest — invisible to our physical eyes — before \\nbirth and after death. They manifest between the birth and the \\ndeath only. What is there to grieve about? (2.28) Some look upon \\n\\nthis Spirit as a wonder, another describes it as wonderful, and others hear of it as a wonder. Even after hearing about it very few \\npeople know it. (2.29) O Arjuna, the Spirit that dwells in the body \\nof all beings is eternally indestructible. Therefore, you should not \\nmourn for anybody. (2.30) \\nDuty of a warrior\\nConsidering also your duty as a warrior, you should not waver. \\nBecause there is nothing more auspicious for a warrior than a righteous war. (2.31) Only the fortunate warriors, O Arjuna, get such an \\nopportunity for a righteous war against evil that is like an open door \\nto heaven. (2.32)\\nCommentary\\nThe righteous war is not a religious war against the \\nfollowers of other religions. The righteous war may be waged \\neven against our own evil-doer kith and kin (RigVeda\\n6.75.19). Life is a continuous battle between the forces of evil \\nand goodness. “Whosoever kills an innocent human being, it shall \\nbe regarded as if he has killed the entire humanity.” (Surah 5.32). \\nIt is better to die for a right cause and acquire the grace of \\nsacrifice than to die an ordinary but compulsory death. The gates \\nof heaven open wide for those who stand up to vindicate justice \\nand righteousness (Dharma). Not to oppose an evil is to indirectly \\nsupport it. Very similar ideas are expressed in other scriptures of \\nthe world. The Bible says: Happy are those who suffer persecution \\nbecause they do what God requires. The kingdom of heaven \\nbelongs to them (MATTHEW 5.10). There is no sin in killing an \\naggressor. Whosoever helps and supports an aggressor is also an \\naggressor. Thus, all those who supported Kauravas were basically \\naggressors and deserved to be eliminated.\\nIf you will not fight this righteous war, then you will fail in your \\nduty, lose your reputation, and incur sin. (2.33) People will talk \\nabout your disgrace forever. To the honored, dishonor is worse \\nthan death. (2.34) The great warriors will think that you have retreated from the battle out of fear. Those who have greatly esteemed you will lose respect for you. (2.35) Your enemies will \\nspeak many unmentionable words and scorn your ability. What \\ncould be more painful to you than this? (2.36) You will go to heaven \\nif killed in the line of duty, or you will enjoy the kingdom on the earth \\nif victorious. Therefore, get up with a determination to fight, O Arjuna. (2.37) Treating pleasure and pain, gain and loss, and victory \\nand defeat alike, engage yourself in your duty. By doing your duty \\nthis way, you will not incur sin. (2.38) \\nImportance of Karma-yoga, the selfless action\\nThe wisdom of spiritual knowledge has been imparted to you, \\nO Arjuna. Now listen to the wisdom of Karma-yoga, the selfless \\nservice (Seva), endowed with which you will free yourself from the \\nbondage or reactions of action (Karma). (2.39) In Karma-yoga, no \\neffort is ever lost and there is no adverse effect. Even a little practice of this discipline protects one from the great fear of birth and \\ndeath. (2.40) A Karma-yogi has a resolute determination for Godrealization, O Arjuna, but the desires of one who works to enjoy the \\nfruits of work are endless. (2.41) \\nMaterial and spiritual aspects of life\\nThe misguided ones who delight in the melodious chanting of \\nthe Vedas or any scripture — without understanding its real purpose — think, O Arjuna, as if there is nothing else in it except the \\nrituals for the sole purpose of obtaining heavenly enjoyment. (2.42) \\nThey are dominated by material desires and consider the attainment of heaven as the highest goal of life. They engage in specific \\nrites for the sake of prosperity and enjoyment. Rebirth is the result \\nof their action. (2.43) The resolute determination of Self-realization \\nis not formed in the minds of those who are attached to pleasure \\nand power and whose judgment is obscured by such ritualistic activities. (2.44) A portion of the Vedas deals with three modes or \\nstates of the material Nature. Become free from pairs of opposites; \\nbe ever balanced and unconcerned with the thoughts of acquisition \\nand preservation. Rise above the three states, and be Self-conscious, O Arjuna. (2.45) To a Self-realized person, scriptures are \\nas useful as a small reservoir of water when the water of a huge \\nlake becomes available. (2.46) \\nTheory and practice of Karma-yoga\\nYou have control over your respective duty only, but no control \\nor claim over the results. The fruits of work should not be your only \\nmotive and you should never be inactive. (2.47) Do your duty to \\nthe best of your ability, O Arjuna, with your mind attached to the \\nLord, abandoning worry and attachment to the results, and remaining calm in both success and failure. The calmness of mind is \\ncalled Karma-yoga. (2.48) Work done with selfish motives is inferior by far to selfless service or Karma-yoga. Therefore, be a \\nKarma-yogi, O Arjuna. Those who work only to enjoy the fruits of \\ntheir labor are, in truth, unhappy. Because, one has no control over \\n\\n\\nthe results. (2.49) \\nA true Karma-yogi becomes free from both vice and virtue in \\nthis very life. Therefore, strive for Karma-yoga. Working to the best \\nof one’s abilities without becoming attached to the fruits of work is \\ncalled Karma-yoga. (2.50) Wise Karma-yogis are freed from the \\nbondage of rebirth by renouncing attachment to the fruits of all \\nwork and attain a blissful divine state. (2.51) When your intellect \\ncompletely pierces the veil of confusion, then you will become indifferent to what has been heard and what is to be heard from the \\nscriptures. (2.52) \\n\\nWhen your intellect, that is confused by the conflicting opinions \\nand the ritualistic doctrine of the Vedas, shall stay steady and firm \\non concentrating on the Supreme Being, then you shall attain union \\nwith the Supreme Being in trance. (2.53) Arjuna said: O Krishna, \\nwhat are the marks of an enlightened person whose intellect is\\nsteady? How does a person of steady intellect speak? How does \\nsuch a person sit and walk? (2.54) \\nMarks of a Self-realized person\\nThe Supreme Lord said: When one is completely free from all \\ndesires of the mind and is satisfied with the Eternal Being (God) by \\nthe joy of Eternal Being, then one is called an enlightened person, \\nO Arjuna. (2.55) A person whose mind is unperturbed by sorrow, \\nwho does not crave pleasures — and who is completely free from \\nattachment, fear, and anger— is called a sage of steady mind. \\n(2.56) Those who are not attached to anything, who are neither \\nelated by getting desired results, nor troubled by undesired results, \\ntheir intellect is considered steady. (2.57) When one can completely withdraw the senses from its sense objects— as a tortoise \\nwithdraws its limbs into the shell for protection from dangers— then \\nthe intellect of such a person is considered steady. (2.58) The desire for sensual pleasures fades away if one abstains from sense \\nenjoyment, but the craving for sense enjoyment remains. The craving also disappears from one who has known the Supreme Being. \\n(2.59) \\nDangers of unrestrained senses\\nRestless senses, O Arjuna, forcibly carry away the mind of \\neven a wise person striving for perfection. (2.60) One should fix \\none’s mind on Me with loving contemplation after bringing the \\nsenses under control. One’s intellect becomes steady when one’s \\nsenses are under complete control. (2.61) One develops attachment to sense objects by thinking about sense objects. Desire for \\nsense objects comes from attachment to sense objects, and anger \\ncomes from unfulfilled desires. (2.62) Delusion or wild ideas arise \\nfrom anger. The mind is bewildered by delusion. Reasoning is destroyed when the mind is bewildered. One falls from the right path \\nwhen reasoning is destroyed. (2.63)\\nPeace through sense control and Self-knowledge\\nA disciplined person, enjoying sense objects with senses that \\nare under control and free from likes and dislikes, attains tranquility. (2.64) All sorrows are destroyed upon attainment of tranquility. \\nThe intellect of such a tranquil person soon becomes completely \\nsteady and united with the Source. (2.65) There is neither Selfknowledge nor Self-perception to those who are not united with the \\nEternal Being. Without Self-perception there is no peace, and without peace there can be no happiness. (2.66) \\nThe mind, when controlled by roving senses, steals away the \\nintellect as a storm takes away a boat on the sea from its destination — the spiritual shore. (2.67) Therefore, O Arjuna, one’s intellect becomes steady when the senses are completely withdrawn \\nfrom its sense objects. (2.68) A yogi, the person of self-restraint, \\nremains wakeful when it is night for all others. It is night for a yogi \\nwho sees when all others are wakeful. (2.69)\\nNOTE: What is considered real by a yogi is of no value for \\na worldly person and vice-versa.\\nOne attains peace when all desires dissipate within the mind \\nwithout creating any mental disturbance, just as river waters enter \\nthe full ocean without creating any disturbance. One who desires \\nmaterial objects is never peaceful. (2.70) One who abandons all \\ndesires, and becomes free from longing and the feeling of “i” and \\n“my”, attains peace. (2.71) O Arjuna, this is the superconscious \\nstate of mind. Attaining this state, one is no longer deluded. Gaining this state, even at the end of one’s life, a person attains Nirvana \\n(or becomes one with the Absolute). (2.72)\\nCHAPTER 3\\n3. Path of Selfless service, Karma-yoga\\nArjuna said: If You consider acquiring spiritual knowledge is \\nbetter than working, then why do You want me to engage in this \\nhorrible war, O Krishna? You seem to confuse my mind by apparently conflicting words. Tell me, decisively, one thing by which I \\nmay attain the Supreme. (3.01-02) The Supreme Lord said: In this \\nworld, O Arjuna, a twofold path of spiritual discipline has been \\nstated by Me in the past — the path of Self-knowledge for the contemplative, introverts and the path of unselfish work (Seva, Karmayoga) for all others. (3.03) One does not attain freedom from the \\nbondage of Karma by merely abstaining from work. No one attains \\nperfection by merely giving up work. (3.04) Because no one can \\nremain actionless even for a moment, everyone is driven to action \\n— helplessly indeed — by the forces of nature. (3.05) The deluded \\nones, who restrain their organs of action but mentally dwell upon \\n\\n\\nthe sense enjoyment, are called hypocrites. (3.06) \\nWhy one should serve others?\\nOne who controls the senses by a trained and purified mind \\nand intellect, and engages the organs of action to selfless service, \\nis superior, O Arjuna. (3.07) Perform your obligatory duty because \\nworking is indeed better than sitting idle. Even the maintenance of \\nyour body would be impossible without work. (3.08) Human beings \\nare bound by work that is not performed as a selfless service. \\nTherefore, O Arjuna, becoming free from attachment to the fruits \\nof work, do your duty efficiently as a service to Me. (3.09) \\n\\nThe first commandment of the creator\\nBrahma, the creator, in the beginning created human beings \\ntogether with selfless service (Seva, sacrifice) and said: By Seva\\nor sacrifice of self-interest you shall prosper, and Seva shall fulfill \\nall your desires. (3.10) Help the celestial controllers (Devas) with selfless service and they will help you. Thus helping each other, you shall \\nattain the Supreme goal of human life. (3.11) The celestial controllers, pleased by selfless service, will give you desired objects even \\nwithout asking for it. One who enjoys the gift of celestials without \\noffering them anything in return is, indeed, a thief. (3.12) The righteous who eat the remnants of selfless service are freed from all \\nsins, but the impious who cook food only for themselves (without \\nfirst offering to Me, or sharing with others), in truth, eat sin (3.13). \\nThe physical body of living beings is made up of and sustained by \\nfood; food is created by God from five basic elements. God is \\npleased by the sacrifice (Qurbani) of self-interest: The selfless philanthropic work, and blesses selfless persons. Selfless work or sacrifice is our duty. Duty is prescribed in the scriptures. The scriptures\\ncome from God. Thus, the all-pervading God is ever present in \\nselfless service, Seva. (3.14-15) One who does not help to keep \\nthe wheel of creation in motion by sacrificial duty and who rejoices \\nsense pleasures only, that sinful person lives in vain, O Arjuna. \\n(3.16) For a Self-realized person, who rejoices only with God, who \\nis delighted with God and who is content with God, there is no duty. \\n(3.17) Such a person has no interest, whatsoever, in what is done \\nor what is not done. A Self-realized person does not depend on \\nanybody, except God, for anything. (3.18) \\nLeaders should set an example\\nTherefore, always perform your duty efficiently and without any \\nattachment to the results, because by doing work without attachment one attains the Supreme Being. (3.19) King Janaka and others attained perfection (or Self-realization) by selfless service \\n(Karma-yoga) alone. You should also perform your duty with a view \\nto guide people, and for universal welfare of the society. (3.20) \\nWhatever noble persons do, others follow. Whatever standard they \\nset up, the world follows. (3.21) O Arjuna, there is nothing in the \\nthree worlds (heaven, earth, and the lower regions) that should be \\ndone by Me, nor there is anything that I should obtain, yet I engage \\nin action. (3.22) If I do not engage in action relentlessly, O Arjuna, \\npeople would follow My path. These worlds would perish if I do not \\nwork, and I would be the cause of confusion and destruction of all \\nthese people. (3.23-24) As the ignorant work, O Arjuna, with attachment to the fruits of work, so the wise should work without attachment, for the welfare of the society. (3.25) The wise should not \\nunsettle the minds of the ignorant, who are attached to the fruits of \\nwork, but should inspire others by performing all works, efficiently,\\nwithout attachment to results. (3.26) \\nAll works are the works of Nature\\nAll work is done by the energy and power of nature, but due to \\ndelusion of ignorance, people assume themselves to be the doer\\nand thus incur sin or Karmic bondage. (3.27) One who knows the \\ntruth, O Arjuna, about the role of the forces of nature and work, \\ndoes not become attached to work, knowing very well that it’s the \\nforces of nature that work with their instruments — our organs. \\n(3.28) Those who are deluded by the illusive power (Maya) of Nature become attached to the work done by the forces of nature. \\nThe wise should not disturb the mind of the ignorant whose \\nknowledge is imperfect. (3.29) Do your duty — dedicating all work \\nto Me — in a spiritual frame of mind, free from desire, attachment, \\nand mental grief. (3.30) Those who always practice this teaching \\nof Mine — with faith, sincerity and free from complain — are freed \\nfrom the bondage of Karma. But those who carp at My teaching \\nand do not practice it, should be considered ignorant of all \\nknowledge, senseless, and lost. (3.31-32) All beings follow their \\nnature. Even the wise act according to their own nature. What, \\nthen, is the value of sense restraint? (3.33)\\nTwo stumbling blocks on the path \\nLikes and dislikes for sense objects remain in the senses. One \\nshould not come under the control of these two, because they are, \\nindeed, two major stumbling blocks on one’s path of Self-realization. (3.34) One’s inferior natural work is better than superior unnatural work. Death in carrying out one’s natural work is useful. \\nUnnatural work produces too much stress. (3.35) \\nLust is the origin of sin\\nArjuna said: O Krishna, what impels one to commit sin as if \\nunwillingly and forced against one’s will? (3.36) The Supreme Lord \\nsaid: It is lust (or intense desire for material and sensual pleasures), born out of passion, that becomes anger when unfulfilled. \\nLust is insatiable and is a great devil. Know this as the enemy. \\n(3.37) As the fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror by dust, and as \\n\\n\\nan embryo by the amnion, similarly Self-knowledge becomes obscured by lust. (3.38) O Arjuna, Self-knowledge becomes covered \\nby this insatiable fire of lust, the eternal enemy of the wise. (3.39) \\nThe senses, the mind, and the intellect are said to be the seat of \\nlust. Lust — by controlling the senses, the mind, and the intellect \\n— deludes a person by veiling Self-knowledge. (3.40) Therefore, \\nO Arjuna, by controlling the senses first, kill this devil of material \\ndesire that destroys Self-knowledge and Self-realization. (3.41) \\nHow to control lust\\nThe senses are said to be superior to the body; the mind is \\nsuperior to the senses; the intellect is superior to the mind; and \\n\\nSpirit is superior to the intellect. (3.42) Thus, knowing the Spirit to \\nbe superior to the intellect, and controlling the mind by the intellect \\nthat is purified by spiritual practices, one must kill this mighty enemy, lust, O Arjuna. (3.43)\\nCHAPTER 4\\n4. Path of renunciation with Self-knowledge\\nKarma-yoga is an ancient law \\nThe Supreme Lord said: I taught this Karma-yoga, the eternal \\nscience of selfless action, to King Vivasvan. Vivasvan taught it to \\nManu. Manu taught it to Ikshvaku. Thus handed down in succession the saintly Kings knew this. After a long time the science of \\nKarma-yoga was lost from this earth. Today I have described the \\nsame ancient science to you because you are my sincere devotee \\nand friend. Karma-yoga is the supreme secret indeed. (4.01-03) \\nArjuna said: You were born later, but Vivasvan was born in ancient \\ntime. How am I to understand that You taught this Karma-yoga in \\nthe beginning of the creation? (4.04)\\nThe purpose of incarnation of God\\nThe Supreme Lord said: Both you and I have taken many \\nbirths. I remember them all, O Arjuna, but you do not remember. \\n(4.05) Though I am eternal, immutable, and the Lord of all beings, \\nyet I manifest myself by controlling My own material Nature, using \\nMy divine potential energy (Maya). (4.06) Whenever there is a decline of Dharma (Righteousness) and a predominance of Adharma \\n(or Unrighteousness), O Arjuna, then I manifest Myself. I appear \\nfrom time to time for protecting the good, for transforming the \\nwicked, and for establishing world order (Dharma). (4.07-08) The \\none who truly understands My transcendental appearance and activities of creation, maintenance, and dissolution, attains My supreme abode and is not born again after leaving this body, O Arjuna. (4.09) Many have become free from attachment, fear, anger, \\nand attained salvation by taking refuge in Me, becoming fully absorbed in My thoughts, and becoming purified by the fire of Selfknowledge. (4.10) \\nPath of worship and prayer\\nWith whatever motive people worship Me, I fulfill their desires \\naccordingly. People worship Me with different motives. (4.11) \\nThose who long for success in their work here on the earth worship \\nthe celestial controllers. Success in work comes quickly in this human world. (4.12) The four divisions — based on aptitude and vocation — of human society were created by Me. Though I am the \\nauthor of this system of the division of labor, one should know that \\nI do nothing and I am eternal. (4.13) Work or Karma does not bind \\nMe, because I have no desire for the fruits of work. The one who \\nfully understands and practices this truth is also not bound by \\nKarma. (4.14) The ancient seekers of liberation also performed \\ntheir duties with this understanding. Therefore, you should do your \\nduty as the ancients did. (4.15)\\nAttached, detached, and forbidden action\\nEven the wise ones are confused about what is action and what \\nis inaction. Therefore, I shall clearly explain what is action, knowing \\nthat one shall be liberated from the evil of birth and death. (4.16) \\nThe true nature of action is very difficult to understand. Therefore, \\none should know the nature of attached or selfish action, the nature \\nof detached or selfless action, and also the nature of forbidden action. (4.17) \\nA Karma-yogi is not subject to the Karmic laws\\nThe one who sees inaction in action, and action in inaction, is \\na wise person. Such a person is a yogi and has accomplished everything. (4.18) \\nTo see inaction in action and vice versa is to understand that \\nthe Lord does all the work indirectly through His power by using us. \\nHe is the inactive actor. We are actively inactive, because we cannot do anything without the flow of His power. Therefore, we are \\nnot the doer, just an instrument in His hands.\\nA person, whose desires have become selfless by being \\nroasted in the fire of Self-knowledge, is called a sage by the wise. \\n(4.19) The one who has abandoned attachment to the fruits of \\nwork, and remains ever content and dependent on no one but God, \\nsuch a person — though engaged in activity — does nothing at all \\nand incurs no Karmic reaction, good or bad. (4.20) The one who is \\nfree from desires, whose mind and senses are under control, and \\nwho has renounced all proprietorship, does not incur sin — the \\nKarmic reaction — by doing bodily action. (4.21) Content with \\n\\n\\nwhatever gain comes naturally by His will, unaffected by pairs of \\nopposites, free from envy, calm in success and failure, though engaged in work, such a Karma-yogi is not bound by Karma. (4.22) \\nThe one who is free from attachment, whose mind is fixed in Selfknowledge, who does work as a service (Seva) to the Lord, all Karmic bonds of such a philanthropic person (Karma-yogi) dissolve \\naway. (4.23) God shall be realized by the one who considers everything as a manifestation or an act of God. (Also see 9.16) (4.24) \\nDifferent types of spiritual practices \\nSome yogis perform the service of worship to celestial controllers (Devas, guardian angels), while others study scriptures for \\nSelf-knowledge. Some restrain their senses and give up their sensual pleasures. Others perform breathing and other yogic exercises. Some give charity and offer their wealth as a sacrifice. (4.25-\\n\\n28) Those who are engaged in yogic practices, reach the breathless state of trance (Samadhi) by offering inhalation into exhalation \\nand exhalation into inhalation as a sacrifice using yogic techniques. \\n(4.29) Others restrict their diet and offer their inhalations as sacrifice into their inhalations. All these people are the knowers of sacrifice, and are purified by their sacrifice. (4.30) Those who perform \\nselfless service obtain the nectar of Self-knowledge as a result of \\ntheir sacrifice and attain the Eternal Being. O Arjuna, even this \\nworld is not a happy place for the non-sacrificer, how can the other \\nworld be? (4.31) Many types of spiritual disciplines are described \\nin the Vedas. Know them all to be born from Karma or the action \\nof body, mind, and senses. Knowing this, you shall attain Nirvana. \\n(4.32) \\nA superior spiritual practice\\nThe acquisition and propagation of Self-knowledge are superior to any material gain or gift, O Arjuna. Because all actions in \\ntheir entirety culminate in knowledge. (4.33) Acquire this spiritual\\nknowledge from a Self-realized guru by humble reverence, by sincere inquiry, and by service. The wise ones who have realized the \\nTruth will teach you. (4.34) After knowing the Truth, O Arjuna, you \\nshall not again become deluded like this. By this knowledge you \\nshall behold the entire creation first within Me, the Supreme Being, \\nthen within your own higher self and then see Me alone in everything. (4.35) Even if one is the most sinful of all sinners, one shall \\nyet cross over the ocean of sin by the raft of Self-knowledge. (4.36) \\nAs the blazing fire reduces wood to ashes; similarly, the fire of Selfknowledge reduces all bonds of Karma (or sin) to ashes, O Arjuna. \\n(4.37)\\nSpiritual knowledge is revealed to a Karma-yogi\\nIn truth, there is no purifier in this world like the true knowledge \\nof the Supreme Being. One who becomes purified by Karma-yoga\\ndiscovers this knowledge within, naturally, in due course of time. \\n(4.38) The one who has faith and is sincere in yogic practices and \\nhas control over the senses, gains this spiritual knowledge. Having \\ngained this knowledge, one at once attains supreme peace. (4.39) \\nThe irrational, the faithless, and the atheist perish. There is neither \\nthis world, nor the world beyond, nor happiness for the disbeliever. \\n(4.40)\\nKnowledge, Karma-yoga are needed for Nirvana\\nWork (Karma) does not bind a person who has renounced work \\nby renouncing attachment to the fruits of work, and whose doubts \\nabout the Self are completely destroyed by Self-knowledge, O Arjuna. (4.41) Therefore, cut the ignorance-born doubt about the Supreme Being abiding in your mind by the sword of Self-knowledge, \\nresort to Karma-yoga, and get up for the war, O Arjuna. (4.42) \\nCHAPTER 5\\n5. Path of renunciation\\nArjuna said: O Krishna, You praise spiritual knowledge and \\nalso performance of selfless service. Tell me, definitely, which one \\nis the better of the two. (5.01) The Supreme Lord said: The path of \\nSelf-knowledge and the path of selfless service both lead to the \\nsupreme goal. But, of the two, selfless service is superior to Selfknowledge. (5.02) A person should be considered a true Samnyasi \\n(renunciant) who neither likes nor dislikes. One is easily liberated \\nfrom Karmic bondage by becoming free from the pairs of opposites, O Arjuna. (5.03) \\nBoth paths lead to the Supreme\\nThe ignorant — not the wise — consider the path of Selfknowledge (or renunciation) and the path of selfless service \\n(Karma-yoga) as different from each other. The person who has \\ntruly mastered one, gets the benefits of both. (5.04) Whatever goal \\na Samnyasi reaches, a Karma-yogi also reaches the same goal. \\nTherefore, the one who sees the path of renunciation and the path \\nof unselfish work as the same, really sees. (5.05) But, true renunciation, O Arjuna, is difficult to attain without Karma-yoga. A sage \\nequipped with Karma-yoga quickly attains God. (5.06) A Karmayogi whose mind is pure, whose mind and senses are under control, and who sees one and the same Eternal Being in all beings, \\nis not bound by Karma though intensely engaged in work. (5.07) \\nA Karma-yogi works for God only\\nThe wise (or Samnyasi) who knows the truth thinks: \"I do nothing at all\". In seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, walking, \\nsleeping, breathing; and speaking, giving, taking, as well as opening and closing the eyes, a Samnyasi believes that only the senses \\nare operating upon their objects. (5.08-09) One who does all work \\nas an offering to the Lord — abandoning attachment to the results \\n— remains untouched by Karmic reaction or sin as a lotus leaf \\nnever gets wet by water, while living in it. (5.10) The Karma-yogis \\nperform action —without attachment — with their body, mind, intellect, and senses only for self-purification. (5.11) A Karma-yogi\\n\\n\\nattains Supreme Bliss by abandoning attachment to the fruits of \\nwork; while others, who are attached to the fruits of work, become \\nbound by selfish work. (5.12)\\nThe path of Self-knowledge\\nA person who has completely renounced attachment to the \\nfruits of all works, lives happily, neither performing nor directing any \\naction. (5.13) The Lord neither creates the urge for action, nor the \\nfeeling of doership, nor the attachment to the results of action in \\npeople. All these are done by the powers of Nature. (5.14) The \\nLord does not take the responsibility for the good or evil deeds of \\n\\nanybody. The Self-knowledge becomes covered by the veil of ignorance; thereby people become deluded and do evil deeds. (5.15) \\nSpiritual knowledge destroys the ignorance of the Self and reveals \\nthe Supreme, just as the Sun reveals the beauty of objects of the \\nworld. (5.16) Persons whose mind and intellect are totally merged \\nwith the Source, who are firmly devoted to the Source, who have \\nthe Source as their supreme goal and sole refuge, and whose impurities are destroyed by the knowledge of the Source, do not take \\nbirth again. (5.17) \\nAdditional marks of an enlightened person\\nAn enlightened person — by perceiving the Lord in all — looks \\nat a learned and humble priest, an outcast, even a cow, an elephant, or a dog with an equal eye. (5.18) Everything has been accomplished in this very life by the one whose mind is set in equality. \\nSuch a person has realized God, because God is flawless and impartial. (5.19) One who neither rejoices on obtaining what is pleasant, nor grieves on obtaining the unpleasant, who has a steady \\nmind, who is undeluded, and who is a knower of the Supreme Being, such a person eternally abides with the Supreme Being. (5.20) \\nSuch a person who is in union with the Supreme Being becomes \\nunattached to sensual pleasures by discovering the joy of the Self \\nthrough contemplation, and enjoys spiritual bliss. (5.21) Sensual \\npleasures are, in truth, the source of misery, and have a beginning \\nand an end. Therefore, the wise do not rejoice sensual pleasures. \\n(5.22) One who is able to withstand the impulse of lust and anger \\nbefore death is a yogi, and a happy person. (5.23) One who finds \\nhappiness with the Eternal Being, who rejoices Eternal Being \\nwithin, and who is illuminated by Self-knowledge; such a yogi attains Nirvana, and goes to Eternal Being. (5.24) Seers whose sins \\n(or imperfections) are destroyed, whose doubts have been dispelled by Self-knowledge, whose minds are disciplined, and who \\nare engaged in the welfare of all beings, attain the Supreme Being. \\n(5.25) They, who are free from lust and anger, who have subdued \\nthe mind and senses, and who have known the Self, easily attain \\nNirvana. (5.26)\\nPath of meditation and contemplation\\nA sage is liberated by renouncing all material enjoyments, focusing the eyes and the mind between the eye-brows, equalizing \\nthe breath moving through the nostrils by using yogic techniques, \\nkeeping the senses, mind, and intellect under control, having salvation as the prime goal, and by becoming free from lust, anger, \\ngreed and fear. (5.27-28) My devotee attains peace by knowing \\nMe, the Supreme Being as the enjoyer of sacrifices and austerities, \\nas the great Lord of all the universe, and the friend of all beings. \\n(5.29) \\nCHAPTER 6\\n6. Path of meditation\\nA Karma-yogi is also a renunciant\\nThe Supreme Lord said: One who performs the prescribed duty \\nwithout seeking its fruit only for personal enjoyment, is a renunciant \\n(Samnyasi) and a Karma-yogi. One does not become Samnyasi \\nmerely by not lighting the fire, and one does not become a yogi \\nmerely by abstaining from work. (6.01) O Arjuna, what they call \\nrenunciation (Samnyasa) is also known as Karma-yoga. No one \\nbecomes a Karma-yogi who has not renounced the selfish motive \\nbehind an action. (6.02) \\nA definition of yoga and yogi\\nFor the wise who seeks to attain yoga of meditation or calmness of mind, Karma-yoga is said to be the means. For the one \\nwho has attained yoga, the calmness becomes the means of Selfrealization. A person is said to have attained yogic perfection when \\none has no desire for sensual pleasures or attachment to the fruits \\nof work, and has renounced all selfish motives behind any action. \\n(6.03-04)\\nMind is both a friend and an enemy\\nOne must elevate — and not degrade — oneself by one’s own \\nmind. The mind alone is one’s friend as well as one’s enemy. The \\nmind is the friend of those who have control over it, and the same \\nmind acts like an enemy for those who do not control it. (6.05-06)\\nOne who has control over the lower self — the mind and senses \\n— is tranquil in heat and cold, in pleasure and pain, and in honor \\nand dishonor, and remains ever steadfast with the supreme Self. \\n(6.07) A person is called yogi who has both Self-knowledge and\\nSelf-realization, who is calm, who has control over the mind and \\nsenses, and to whom a clod, a stone, and gold are the same. (6.08) \\nA person is considered superior who is impartial towards companions, friends, enemies, neutrals, arbiters, haters, relatives, saints, \\nand sinners. (6.09) \\nTechniques of meditation\\nA yogi, seated in solitude and alone, should constantly try to \\ncontemplate the Supreme Being after bringing the mind and \\n\\n\\nsenses under control, and becoming free from desires and proprietorship. (6.10) One should sit on his or her own firm seat that is \\nneither too high nor too low, covered with dry grass, a deerskin, \\nand a cloth, one over the other, in a clean spot. Sitting there in a \\ncomfortable position and concentrating the mind on God, controlling the thoughts and the activities of the senses, one should practice meditation for self-purification. (6.11-12) One should sit by \\nholding the waist, spine, chest, neck, and head erect, motionless \\nand steady; fix the eyes and the mind steadily in front of the nostrils, without looking around; make your mind serene and fearless; \\npractice celibacy; have the mind under control; think of Me; and \\n\\nhave Me as the supreme goal. (6.13-14) Thus, by always practicing to keep the mind fixed on Me, the yogi whose mind is subdued \\nattains peace of Nirvana and comes to Me. (6.15) \\nThis yoga is not possible, O Arjuna, for the one who eats too \\nmuch or who does not eat at all; who sleeps too much or who keeps \\nawake. (6.16) But for the one who is moderate in eating, recreation, \\nworking, sleeping, and waking, the yoga of meditation destroys all \\nsorrow. (6.17) A person is said to have achieved yoga, the union \\nwith the Eternal Being, when the perfectly disciplined mind becomes free from all desires and gets completely united with God in \\nSamadhi (trance). (6.18) A lamp in a spot sheltered by the Eternal \\nBeing from the wind of desires does not flicker; this simile is used \\nfor the subdued mind of a yogi, practicing meditation on the Eternal \\nBeing. (6.19) \\nWhen the mind, disciplined by the practice of meditation, becomes steady, one becomes content with the Eternal Being by beholding Him with purified intellect. (6.20) One feels infinite bliss that \\nis perceivable only through the intellect and is beyond the reach of \\nthe senses. After realizing the Eternal Being, one is never separated from the Absolute Reality. (6.21) After Self-realization (SR), \\none does not regard any other gain superior to SR. Established in \\nSR, one is not moved even by the greatest calamity. (6.22) The \\nstate of severance of union with sorrow is called yoga. This yoga \\nshould be practiced with firm determination and without any mental \\nreservation. (6.23) One gradually attains tranquility of mind by totally abandoning all selfish desires, completely restraining the \\nsenses from the sense objects by the intellect, keeping the mind \\nfully absorbed in the Eternal Being by means of a well-trained and \\npurified intellect, and thinking of Me. (6.24-25) Wheresoever this \\nrestless and unsteady mind wanders away during meditation, one \\nshould just witness it under the supervision of the Self. (6.26) \\nWho is a yogi?\\nSupreme bliss comes to a Self-realized yogi, whose mind is \\ntranquil, whose desires are under control, and who is free from sin \\n(or faults). (6.27) Such a sinless yogi, who constantly engages his \\nor her mind and intellect with the Eternal Being, easily enjoys the \\ninfinite bliss of contact with God. (6.28) Because of perceiving the \\nomnipresent Eternal Being abiding in all beings, and all beings \\nabiding in the Eternal Being; a yogi, who is in union with the Eternal \\nBeing, sees every being with an equal eye. (6.29) Those who perceive Me in everything and behold everything in Me, are not separated from Me, and I am not separated from them. (6.30) The nondualists, who adore Me as abiding in all beings, abide in Me irrespective of their mode of living. (6.31) One is considered the best \\nyogi who regards every being like oneself and who can feel the \\npain and pleasures of others as one’s own, O Arjuna. (6.32) \\nTwo methods to subdue the mind\\nArjuna said: O Krishna, You have said that the yoga of meditation is characterized by the calmness of mind, but due to restlessness of mind, I do not perceive the steady state of mind. Because \\nthe mind, indeed, is very unsteady, turbulent, powerful, and obstinate, O Krishna. I think restraining the mind is as difficult as restraining the wind. (6.33-34) The Supreme Lord said: Undoubtedly, \\nO Arjuna, the mind is restless and difficult to restrain, but it is subdued by constant vigorous spiritual practice with perseverance, \\nSelf-knowledge and detachment, O Arjuna. (6.35) In My opinion, \\nyoga is difficult for the one whose mind is not subdued. However, \\nyoga is attainable by the person of subdued mind by striving \\nthrough proper means. (6.36) \\nDestination of unsuccessful yogi\\nArjuna said: The faithful who deviates from the path of meditation and fails to attain yogic perfection due to unsubdued mind —\\nwhat is the destination of such a person, O Krishna? (6.37) Does \\nhe not perish like a dispersing cloud, O Krishna, having lost both \\nworldly and heavenly pleasures; supportless and bewildered on \\nthe path of Self-realization? (6.38) O Krishna, only You are able to \\ncompletely dispel this doubt of mine because there is none, other \\nthan You, who can dispel this doubt. (6.39) The Supreme Lord \\nsaid: There is no destruction, O Arjuna, for a yogi either here or \\nhereafter. A spiritualist is never put to grief, My dear friend. (6.40) \\nThe unsuccessful yogi is reborn in the house of the pious and \\nprosperous after attaining heaven and living there for many years, \\nor such a yogi is born in a family of enlightened yogis. A birth like \\nthis is very difficult, indeed, to obtain in this world. (6.41-42) There \\na yogi regains the knowledge acquired in the previous life and \\nstrives again to achieve perfection, O Arjuna. (6.43) The unsuccessful yogi is instinctively carried towards the Eternal Being by \\nvirtue of the impressions (Samskara) of yogic practices of previous \\nlives. Even the inquirer of yoga — the union with God — surpasses \\nthose who perform Vedic rituals. (6.44) The yogi who diligently \\n\\n\\nstrives, becomes completely free from all sins or imperfections after gradually perfecting through many incarnations, and reaches \\nthe Supreme Abode. (6.45) \\nWho is the best yogi?\\nThe yogi is superior to the ascetics. The yogi is superior to the \\nscholars. The yogi is superior to the ritualists. Therefore, O Arjuna, \\nbe a yogi. (6.46) I consider the yogi-devotee — who lovingly contemplates Me with supreme faith, and whose mind is ever absorbed in Me — to be the best of all the yogis. (6.47)\\nCHAPTER 7\\n7. Self-knowledge and enlightenment\\n\\nThe Supreme Lord said: O Arjuna, listen how you shall know \\nMe fully without any doubt, with your mind absorbed in Me, taking \\nrefuge in Me, and performing yogic practices. (7.01) I shall impart \\nyou Self-knowledge, together with enlightenment, after comprehending that nothing more remains to be known in this world. (7.02) \\nScarcely one out of thousands of persons strives for perfection of \\nSelf-realization. Scarcely one among those successful strivers \\ntruly understands Me. (7.03)\\nDefinitions of matter, consciousness, and spirit\\nThe mind, intellect, ego, ether, air, fire, water, and earth are the \\neightfold transformation (or division) of My material energy (Prakriti). (7.04) The material energy is My lower Nature. My other \\nhigher Nature is Spirit (Purusha) by which this entire universe is \\nsustained, O Arjuna. (7.05) Know that all creatures have evolved \\nfrom this twofold energy; and I, the Supreme Being, am the source \\nof origin, as well as dissolution of the entire universe. (7.06) \\nThe Supreme spirit is the basis of everything\\nThere is nothing higher than Me, O Arjuna. Everything in the \\nuniverse is strung on Me like jewels are strung on the thread of a \\nnecklace. (7.07) O Arjuna, I am the sapidity in the water, I am the \\nradiance in the sun and the moon, the sacred syllable ‘OM’ in all \\nthe Vedas, the sound in the ether, and potency in human beings. I \\nam the sweet fragrance in the earth. I am the heat in the fire, the \\nlife in all living beings, and the austerity in the ascetics. (7.08-09) \\nO Arjuna, know Me to be the eternal seed of all creatures. I am the \\nintelligence of the intelligent and the brilliance of the brilliant. I am \\nthe strength of the strong that is devoid of lust and attachment. I \\nam lust (Cupid) in human beings that is in accord with righteousness (Dharma) for the sacred and sole purpose of procreation after \\nmarriage, O Arjuna. (7.10-11) Know that three modes (Gunas) of \\nNature — goodness, passion, and ignorance — also emanate from \\nMe. I am not dependent on or affected by the Gunas, but the Gunas \\nare dependent on Me. (7.12) Human beings are deluded by the \\nvarious aspects of these three Gunas of Nature; therefore, they do \\nnot know Me, who is eternal and above these Gunas. (7.13) \\nWho seeks God?\\nThis divine power (Maya) of Mine, consisting of three modes \\n(Gunas) of Nature, is very difficult to overcome. Only those who \\nsurrender unto Me can easily cross over this Maya. (7.14) The evil \\ndoers, the ignorant, the lowest persons who are attached to demonic nature and whose power of discrimination has been taken \\naway by divine illusive power (Maya) do not worship or seek Me. \\n(7.15) \\nFour types of virtuous ones worship or seek Me, O Arjuna. They \\nare: The distressed, the seeker of Self-knowledge, the seeker of \\nwealth, and the enlightened one who has experienced the Supreme. (7.16) Among them the enlightened devotee, who is ever \\nunited with Me and whose devotion is single-minded, is the best, \\nbecause I am very dear to the enlightened, and the enlightened is \\nalso very dear to Me. (7.17) All these seekers are indeed noble, \\nbut I regard the enlightened devotee as My very Self. One who is \\nsteadfast becomes one with Me and abides in My supreme abode. \\n(7.18) After many births the enlightened one resorts to Me by realizing that everything is, indeed, My manifestation. Such a great \\nsoul is very rare. (7.19) Persons whose judgement has been carried away by various desires, impelled by their Karmic impression \\n(Samskara), resort to celestial controllers and practice various religious rites. (7.20) \\nGod can be seen in any image of worship\\nWhosoever desires to worship whatever deity (using any \\nname, form, and method) with faith, I make their faith steady in that \\nvery deity. Endowed with steady faith, they worship that deity and \\nfulfil their wishes through that deity. Those wishes are, indeed, \\ngranted only by Me. (7.21-22) Such material gains of these less \\nintelligent human beings are temporary. The worshipers of celestial controllers go to celestial controllers, but My devotees certainly \\ncome to Me. (7.23) \\nThe ignorant ones — unable to understand My immutable, incomparable, incomprehensible and transcendental form, assume \\nthat I am formless and take form just as humans do. (7.24) Concealed by My divine power (Maya), I do not reveal Myself to the \\nignorant ones, who do not know and understand My unborn, eternal, transcendental form and personality — and consider Me formless! (7.25) \\nI know, O Arjuna, the beings of the past, of the present, and \\nthose of the future, but no one really knows Me. (7.26) All beings \\nin this world are in utter ignorance due to delusion of pairs of opposites born of likes and dislikes, O Arjuna. But persons of unselfish deeds, whose Karma or sin has come to an end, become free \\n\\n\\nfrom the delusion of pairs of opposites and worship Me with firm \\nresolve. (7.27-28) Those who strive for freedom from the cycles of \\nbirth, old age, and death by taking refuge in Me; fully comprehend \\nEternal Being, the nature of Eternal Being, and Karma, the power \\nof Eternal Being. (7.29) The steadfast persons who know Me as \\neverything: The mortal beings, temporal Divine Beings, the Supersoul, even at the time of death, attain Me. (7.30)\\nCHAPTER 8\\n8. The eternal being, God\\nArjuna said: O Krishna, who is the Eternal Being? What is the \\nnature of the Eternal Being? What is Karma? Who are the mortal \\n\\nbeings? And who are Divine Beings? Who is the Supersoul, and \\nhow does He dwell in the body? How can You be remembered at \\nthe time of death by those who have control over their minds, O \\nKrishna? (8.01-02)\\nDefinitions of supreme spirit, spirit, individual soul\\nThe Supreme Lord said: The immutable Spirit is called Eternal \\nBeing or God. The nature, including the inherent power of cognition \\nand desire, of God is called Adhyatma. The creative power of God\\nthat causes manifestation of living entities is called Karma. (8.03) \\nMortal beings are called Adhibhuta. The expansions of Divine Personality are called Divine Beings. I am the Supersoul residing inside every cell of living beings as the supreme controller, O Arjuna. \\n(8.04)\\nTheory of reincarnation and Karma\\nThe one who remembers Me exclusively, even while leaving \\nthe body at the time of death, attains Me; there is no doubt about \\nit. (8.05) Remembering whatever object one leaves the body at the \\nend of life, one attains that object, O Arjuna. Because of the constant thought of that object, one remembers that object at the end \\nof life and achieves it. (8.06)\\nA simple method of God-realization\\nTherefore, always remember Me and do your duty. You shall \\ncertainly attain Me if your mind and intellect are ever focused on \\nMe. (8.07) By contemplating on Me with an unwavering mind that \\nis disciplined by the practice of meditation, one attains the Supreme Being, O Arjuna. (8.08) One who meditates on the Supreme \\nBeing — as the omniscient, the oldest, the controller, smaller than \\nthe smallest and bigger than the biggest, sustainer of everything, \\nthe inconceivable, self-luminous like the sun, and beyond material \\nreality — at the time of death with steadfast mind and devotion; \\nmaking the flow of bioimpulses (life forces, Prana) rise up to the \\nmiddle of two eye brows (or the sixth Chakra) by the power of yoga \\nand holding there, attains the Supreme Divine Person. (8.09-10) I \\nshall briefly explain the process to attain the supreme abode that \\nthe knowers of the Veda call immutable; into which the ascetics, \\nfreed from attachment, enter; and desiring which, people lead a life \\nof celibacy. (8.11) \\nAttain salvation by meditating on God\\nWhen one leaves the physical body by controlling all the \\nsenses, focusing the mind on God, engaged in yogic practice, \\nmeditating on Me and uttering OM — the sacred monosyllable \\nsound power of Eternal Being — one attains the supreme abode. \\n(8.12-13) I am easily attainable, O Arjuna, by that ever steadfast \\nyogi who always thinks of e and whose mind does not go elsewhere. (8.14) After attaining Me, the great souls do not incur rebirth \\nin this miserable transitory world because they have attained the \\nhighest perfection. (8.15) The dwellers of all the worlds — up to \\nand including the world of Brahma, the creator — are subject to the \\nmiseries of repeated birth and death. But, after attaining Me, O Arjuna, one does not take birth again. (8.16)\\nEverything in the creation is cyclic\\nThose who know that the day of the creator (Brahma) lasts one \\nthousand Yugas (or 4.32 billion solar years) and that his night also \\nlasts one thousand Yugas, they are the knowers of day and night. \\n(8.17) All manifestations come out of the primary material Nature \\n(Adi-Prakriti) at the arrival of the day of Brahma, the Creative \\nPower, and they again merge into the same at the coming of \\nBrahma’s night. (8.18) The same multitude of beings comes into \\nexistence again and again at the arrival of the day of the creator \\n(Brahma); and are annihilated, inevitably, at the arrival of Brahma’s \\nnight. (8.19) \\nThere is another eternal existence — higher than the changeable material Nature (Prakriti) — that does not perish when all created beings perish. This is called the Eternal Being. This is also \\nsaid to be the supreme abode. Those who attain My supreme \\nabode do not take birth again. (8.20-21) This supreme abode, O \\nArjuna, is attainable by unswerving devotion to Me, within which all \\nbeings exist and by which all this universe is pervaded. (8.22) \\nTwo basic paths of departure after death\\nO Arjuna, now I shall describe different paths departing by \\nwhich, after death, the yogis do or do not come back. (8.23) Passing gradually, after death, through celestial controllers of fire, light, \\ndaytime, the bright lunar fortnight, and the six months of the northern solstice of the sun, yogis who know the Self attain supreme \\nabode and do not come back to earth. (8.24) Passing gradually, \\nafter death, through celestial controllers of smoke, night, the dark \\nlunar fortnight, and the six months of southern solstice of the sun, \\nthe righteous person attains heaven and comes back to earth \\nagain. (8.25) The path of light of Self-knowledge and the path of \\n\\n\\ndarkness of ignorance are thought to be the world’s two eternal \\npaths. The former leads to salvation (Mukti, Nirvana), and the latter \\nleads to rebirth. (8.26) \\nSpiritual knowledge leads to salvation\\nKnowing these two paths, O Arjuna, a yogi is not bewildered at \\nall. Therefore, O Arjuna, be steadfast in yoga (union) with Me at all \\ntimes. (8.27) The yogi who knows all this goes beyond getting the \\nbenefits of the study of the Vedas, performance of sacrifices, austerities, and charities, and attains My Supreme Eternal Abode. \\n(8.28) \\n\\nCHAPTER 9\\n9. Supreme knowledge and the big mystery\\nThe Supreme Lord said: I shall reveal to you, who do not disbelieve, the most profound, secret, spiritual knowledge, together \\nwith spiritual experience. Knowing this, you will be freed from the \\nmiseries of worldly existence. (9.01) \\nKnowledge of the supreme is the biggest mystery\\nThis Self-knowledge is the king of all knowledge, is the most \\nsecret, is very sacred, can be perceived by instinct, conforms to \\nrighteousness (Dharma), is very easy to practice, and is timeless. \\n(9.02) O Arjuna, those who have no faith in this knowledge do not \\nattain Me and follow the cycles of birth and death. (9.03) This entire \\nuniverse is an expansion of Mine. All beings depend on Me. I do \\nnot depend on them, because I am the highest of all. (9.04) Look \\nat the power of My divine mystery; in reality, I — the sustainer and \\ncreator of all beings — do not depend on them, and they also do \\nnot depend on Me. (9.05) \\nNOTE: It’s like a gold-chain depends on gold, and milk products depend on milk. In fact, the gold-chain does not depend on \\ngold; the chain is nothing but gold! Similarly, matter and energy are \\ndifferent as well as non-different.\\nPerceive that all beings remain in Me, without any connection\\nor contact, as the mighty wind, moving everywhere in the sky, eternally remains in space. (9.06) \\nThe theory of evolution and involution\\nAll beings merge into My Adi-Prakriti (primary material Nature) \\nat the end of a cycle of just over 311 trillion solar years, O Arjuna, \\nand I create them again at the beginning of the next cycle. (9.07) I \\ncreate the entire multitude of beings again and again with the help \\nof My material Nature. These beings are under control of the three \\nmodes of material Nature. (9.08) These acts of creation do not bind \\nMe, O Arjuna, because I remain indifferent and unattached to those \\nacts. (9.09) The divine kinetic energy (Maya) — with the help of \\nmaterial Nature — creates all animate and inanimate objects under \\nMy supervision; thus, the creation keeps on going, O Arjuna. (9.10) \\nThe ways of the wise and of the ignorant\\nIgnorant persons hate Me when I appear in human form because they do not know My spiritual nature as the great Lord of all \\nbeings and take Me for an ordinary human. They have false hopes, \\nfalse actions, false knowledge, and delusive qualities (See 16.04-\\n18) of fiends and demons and are unable to recognize Me. (9.11-\\n12) But great souls, O Arjuna, who possess divine qualities (See \\n16.01-03), know Me as immutable, as both the material and efficient cause of creation, and worship Me single-mindedly with loving devotion. (9.13) Persons of firm resolve worship Me with ever \\nsteadfast devotion by always singing My glories, striving to attain \\nMe, and prostrating before Me with devotion. (9.14) Some worship \\nMe by acquiring and propagating Self-knowledge. Others worship \\nthe infinite as the One in all (or non-dual), as the master of all (or \\ndual), and in various other ways. (9.15) \\nEverything is a manifestation of God\\nI am the ritual, I am the sacrifice, I am the offering, I am the \\nherb, I am the mantra, I am the clarified butter, I am the fire, and I \\nam the oblation. I am the supporter of the universe, the father, the \\nmother, and the grandfather. I am the object of knowledge, the sacred syllable ‘OM’, and also the Vedas. I am the goal, the supporter, the Lord, the witness, the abode, the refuge, the friend, the \\norigin, the dissolution, the foundation, the substratum, and the immutable seed. (9.16-18) I give heat. I send, as well as withhold, the \\nrain. I am immortality, as well as death. I am also both the absolute \\nand the temporal, O Arjuna. (9.19)\\nThe Supreme Being has become everything!\\nAttaining salvation by devotional love\\nThe performers of rituals prescribed in the Vedas, the drinkers \\nof the nectar of devotion, whose sins are cleansed, worship Me by \\ndoing good deeds for gaining heaven. As a result of their meritorious deeds, they go to heaven and enjoy celestial sense pleasures. \\n(9.20) They return to the mortal world — after enjoying the wide \\nworld of heavenly pleasures — upon exhaustion of their good \\nKarma. Thus, following the ritualistic injunctions of the Vedas, persons working for the fruit of their actions take repeated birth and \\ndeath. (9.21) \\nI personally take care of both the material and spiritual welfare \\nof those ever-steadfast devotees who always remember and adore \\nMe with single-minded contemplation. (9.22) O Arjuna, even those \\ndevotees who worship the deities with faith, they also worship Me, \\nbut in an improper way. (9.23) Because I — the Supreme Being —\\nalone am the enjoyer of all sacrificial services and Lord of the universe. But people do not know My true, spiritual nature. Therefore, \\n\\n\\nthey fall into the repeated cycles of birth and death. (9.24) Worshippers of the deities go to the deities; worshippers of ancestors \\ngo to the ancestors, and worshippers of the ghosts go to the \\nghosts; but My devotees come to Me and are not born again. (9.25) \\nThe Lord accepts and eats the offering of love\\nWhosoever offers Me a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or water with devotion, I accept and eat the offering of devotion by the purehearted. (9.26) O Arjuna, whatever you do, whatever you eat, \\nwhatever you offer as oblation to the sacred fire, whatever charity \\nyou give, whatever austerity you perform, do all that as an offering \\nunto Me. (9.27) You shall become free from the bondage — good \\n\\nand bad — of Karma by this attitude of complete renunciation \\n(Samnyasa-yoga). Becoming liberated, you shall come to Me. \\n(9.28) \\nThere is no unforgivable sinner\\nThe Self is present equally in all beings. There is no one hateful \\nor dear to Me. But those who worship Me with love and devotion \\nare very close to Me, and I am also very close to them. (9.29) Even \\nif the most sinful person resolves to worship Me with singleminded, loving devotion; such a person must be regarded as a \\nsaint because of making the right resolution. (9.30)\\nThere are no unforgivable sins or sinners. The fire of \\nsincere repentance burns all sins. \\nSuch a person soon becomes righteous and attains everlasting \\npeace. Be aware, O Arjuna, that My devotee shall never perish or \\nfall down. (9.31) \\nThe path of devotional love is easier\\nAnybody — including women, merchants, laborers, and the \\nevil-minded — can attain the supreme abode by just surrendering \\nunto My will with loving devotion, O Arjuna. (9.32) It should then be \\nvery easy for holy priests and devout sages to attain the Supreme.\\nTherefore, having obtained this joyless and transitory human life, \\none should always worship Me with loving devotion. (9.33) Fix your \\nmind on Me, be devoted to Me, worship Me, and bow down to Me. \\nThus, uniting yourself with Me by setting Me as the supreme goal \\nand the sole refuge, you shall certainly come to Me. (9.34) \\nCHAPTER 10\\n10. Manifestation of the absolute\\nThe Supreme Lord said: O Arjuna, listen once again to My supreme word that I shall speak to you, who are very dear to Me, for \\nyour welfare. (10.01) \\nGod is the origin of everything\\nNeither the celestial controllers (Devas), nor the great sages \\nknow My origin because I am the origin of all Devas and great \\nsages also. (10.02) One who knows Me as the unborn, the beginningless, and the Supreme Lord of the universe, is considered wise \\namong the mortals and becomes liberated from the bondage of \\nKarma. (10.03) Intelligence, Self-knowledge, non-delusion, forgiveness, truthfulness, control over the mind and senses, tranquility, pleasure, pain, birth, death, fear, fearlessness, nonviolence, \\ncalmness, contentment, austerity, charity, fame, ill fame — these \\ndiverse qualities in human beings also arise from Me. (10.04-05) \\nThe seven great sages from whom all the creatures of the world \\nwere born, originated from My potential energy. (10.06) \\nOne who truly understands My manifestations and yogic powers, is united with Me by unswerving devotion. There is no doubt \\nabout it. (10.07) I am the origin of all. Everything emanates from \\nMe. Understanding this, the wise adore Me with love and devotion. \\n(10.08) My devotees remain ever content and delighted. Their \\nminds remain absorbed in Me and their lives surrendered unto Me. \\nThey always enlighten each other by talking about Me. (10.09)\\nGod gives spiritual knowledge to His devotees\\nI give knowledge and understanding of metaphysical science \\n— to those who are ever united with Me and lovingly adore Me —\\nby which they come to Me. (10.10) I, who dwell within their inner \\npsyche as consciousness, destroy the darkness born of ignorance \\nby the shining lamp of spiritual knowledge as an act of compassion \\nfor them. (10.11) Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Being, the Supreme Abode, the Supreme Purifier, the Eternal Divine Being, the \\nprimal God, the unborn, and the omnipresent. All sages have thus\\nacclaimed You. And now You Yourself tell me that. (10.12-13) \\nNobody can know the real nature of Reality\\nO Krishna, I believe all that You have told me to be true. O \\nLord, neither the celestial controllers nor the demons fully understand Your real nature. (10.14) O Creator and Lord of all beings, \\nGod of all celestial rulers, Supreme person, and Lord of the universe, You alone know Yourself by Yourself. (10.15) Therefore, \\nYou alone are able to fully describe Your own divine manifestations \\nby which You exist pervading all the universes. (10.16) How may I \\nknow You, O Lord, by constant contemplation? In what form of \\nmanifestation am I to think of You, O Lord? (10.17) O Lord, explain \\nto me again, in detail, Your yogic power and glory because I am \\nnot satiated by hearing Your nectar-like words. (10.18)\\nEverything is a manifestation of the Absolute\\nThe Supreme Lord said: O Arjuna, now I shall explain to you \\nMy prominent divine manifestations because My manifestations \\nare endless. (10.19) O Arjuna, I am the Spirit abiding in the inner \\npsyche of all beings. I am also the beginning, the middle, and the \\nend of all beings. (10.20) I am the sustainer, I am the radiant sun \\namong the luminaries, I am the supernatural controllers of wind, I \\nam the moon among the stars. (10.21) I am the Vedas, I am the \\n\\n\\ncelestial rulers, I am the mind among the senses, I am the consciousness in living beings. (10.22) I am Lord Shiva, I am the god \\nof wealth, I am the god of fire, and the mountains. (10.23) I am the \\npriest and the army general of the celestial controllers, O Arjuna. I \\nam the ocean among the bodies of water. (10.24) I am sage Bhrigu \\namong the great sages; I am the monosyllable cosmic sound, OM\\n, Amin, Allah among the words; I am the silent repetition of mantra \\n(Japa) among the spiritual disciplines; and I am the Himalaya \\namong the mountains. (10.25)\\nA brief description of divine manifestations\\n\\nI am the holy fig tree among the trees, and I am all other celestial rulers. (10.26) Know Me as the celestial animal among the animals and the King among men. I am the thunderbolt among weapons, and I am Cupid for procreation. (10.27-28) I am the water god \\nand the manes. I am the controller of death. I am death among the \\nhealers, lion among the beasts, and the king of birds among birds. \\n(10.29-30) I am the wind among the purifiers and Lord Rama \\namong the warriors. I am the crocodile among the fishes and the \\nholy Ganga river among the rivers. (10.31) \\nI am the beginning, the middle, and the end of all creation, O \\nArjuna. Among knowledge I am knowledge of the supreme Self. I \\nam logic of the logician. (10.32) I am the letter ‘A’ among the alphabets. I am the dual compound among the compound words. I \\nam the endless time. I am the sustainer of all, and have faces on \\nall sides (or I am omniscient). (10.33) I am the all-devouring death \\nand also the origin of future beings. I am the seven goddesses or \\nguardian angels presiding over the seven qualities: Fame, prosperity, speech, memory, intellect, resolve, and forgiveness. (10.34) \\nI am the Vedic hymns. I am Gayatri mantra among the Vedic mantras. I am November-December among the months, I am the spring \\namong the seasons. (10.35) I am gambling of the cheats, splendor \\nof the splendid, victory of the victorious, resolution of the resolute, \\nand goodness of the good. (10.36) \\nI am Krishna, Arjuna, sage Vyasa among the sages, and \\nUshana among the great poets. (10.37) I am the power of rulers, \\nthe statesmanship of the seekers of victory, I am silence among \\nthe secrets, and the Self-knowledge of the knowledgeable. (10.38) \\nI am the origin of all beings, O Arjuna. There is nothing, animate or \\ninanimate, that can exist without Me. (10.39) \\nCreation is a small part of the Absolute\\nThere is no end of My divine manifestations, O Arjuna. This is \\nonly a brief description by Me of the extent of My divine manifestations. (10.40) Whatever is endowed with glory, brilliance, and \\npower — know that to be a manifestation of a very small fraction of \\nMy splendor. (10.41) What is the need for this detailed knowledge, \\nO Arjuna? I continually support the entire universe by a small fraction of My divine power, Maya. (10.42) \\nCHAPTER 11\\n11. Vision of the universal form\\nArjuna said: My illusion is dispelled by the profound words of \\nwisdom You spoke out of compassion for me about the supreme \\nsecret of Eternal Being. (11.01) O Krishna, I have heard from You \\nin detail about the origin and dissolution of beings and Your immutable glory. (11.02) \\nThe vision of God is the ultimate aim of a seeker\\nO Lord, You are as You have said, yet I wish to see Your divine \\ncosmic form, O Supreme Being. (11.03) O Lord, if You think it is \\npossible for me to see Your universal form, then, O Lord of the \\nyogis, show me Your transcendental form. (11.04) The Supreme \\nLord said: O Arjuna, behold My hundreds and thousands of multifarious divine forms of different colors and shapes. Behold all the \\ncelestial beings and many wonders never seen before. Also behold \\nthe entire creation — animate, inanimate, and whatever else you \\nwould like to see — all at one place in My body. (11.05-07) But you \\nare not able to see Me with your physical eye; therefore, I give you \\nthe divine eye to see My majestic power and glory. (11.08)\\nLord Krishna shows His cosmic form \\nSanjaya said: O King, having said this, Lord Krishna, the great \\nLord of the mystic power of yoga, revealed His supreme majestic \\nform to Arjuna. (11.09) Arjuna saw the Universal Form of the Lord \\nwith many mouths and eyes, and many marvelous visions with numerous divine ornaments, holding many divine weapons, wearing \\ndivine garlands and apparel, anointed with celestial perfumes and \\nointments, full of all wonders — the limitless God with faces on all \\nsides. (11.10-11) If the splendor of thousands of suns were to blaze \\nforth all at once in the sky, even that would not resemble the splendor of that exalted being. (11.12) Arjuna saw the entire universe, \\ndivided in many ways, but standing as all in One in the transcendental body of Krishna, the Lord of celestial rulers. (11.13) \\nOne may not be prepared or qualified to see God\\nUpon seeing the cosmic form of the Lord, Arjuna was filled with \\nwonder; and his hairs standing on end, bowed his head to the Lord \\nand prayed with folded hands. (11.14) Arjuna said: O Lord, I see in \\nYour body all supernatural controllers and multitudes of beings, all \\nsages, celestial serpents, Lord Shiva, as well as Lord Brahma\\nseated on the lotus. (11.15) O Lord of the universe, I see You everywhere with infinite forms, with many arms, stomachs, faces, and \\neyes. O Universal Form, I see neither your beginning nor the middle nor the end. (11.16) I see You with crown, club, \\n\\ndiscus, and \\nmassive radiance, difficult to behold, shining all around like the immeasurable brilliance and blazing fire of the sun. (11.17)\\nI believe You are the Supreme Being to be realized. You are the \\nultimate resort of the universe. You are the Eternal Being and protector of the eternal order (Dharma). (11.18) I see You with infinite \\npower, without beginning, middle, or end; with many arms; with the \\nsun and the moon as Your eyes; with Your mouth as a blazing fire, \\nscorching all the universe with Your radiance. (11.19) O Lord, the \\nentire space between heaven and earth in all directions is pervaded by You. Seeing Your marvelous and terrible form, the three \\nworlds are trembling with fear. (11.20) Hosts of supernatural rulers \\n\\nenter into You. Some with folded hands sing Your names and glories in fear. A multitude of perfected beings hail and adore You with \\nabundant praises. (11.21) All the celestial beings amazingly gaze \\nat You. Seeing your infinite form with many mouths, eyes, arms, \\nthighs, feet, stomachs, and many fearful tusks; the worlds are trembling with fear, and so do I, O mighty Lord. (11.22-23)\\nArjuna is frightened to see the Cosmic form\\nSeeing Your effulgent and colorful form touching the sky; Your \\nmouth wide open and large shining eyes; I am frightened and find \\nneither peace nor courage, O Krishna. (11.24) Seeing Your mouths \\nwith fearful tusks, glowing like fires of cosmic dissolution, I lose my \\nsense of direction and find no comfort. Have mercy on me, O Lord \\nof celestial rulers, refuge of the universe! (11.25) All my cousin \\nbrothers, along with the hosts of other kings and warriors of the \\nother side, together with chief warriors on our side, are also quickly \\nentering into Your fearful mouths with terrible tusks. Some are \\nseen caught in between the tusks with their heads crushed. (11.26-\\n27) These warriors of the mortal world are entering Your blazing \\nmouths as many torrents of the rivers enter into the ocean. (11.28) \\nAll these people are rapidly rushing into Your mouths for destruction as moths rush with great speed into the blazing flame for destruction. (11.29) You are licking up all the worlds with Your flaming \\nmouths, swallowing them from all sides. Your powerful radiance is \\nfilling the entire universe with effulgence and burning it, O Krishna. \\n(11.30) Tell me who You are in such a fierce form? My salutations \\nto You, O best of all celestial rulers, be merciful! I wish to understand You, O primal Being, because I do not know Your mission. \\n(11.31) \\nWe are only a divine instrument\\nThe Supreme Lord said: I am death, the mighty destroyer of \\nthe world. I have come here to destroy all these people. Even without your participation in the war, all the warriors standing arrayed \\nin the opposing armies shall cease to exist. (11.32) Therefore get \\nup and attain glory. Conquer your enemies, and enjoy a prosperous kingdom. All these warriors have already been destroyed by \\nMe. You be a mere My instrument, O Arjuna. (11.33)\\nThis is My battle, not yours. I use you, O Arjuna, only as an \\ninstrument. I do everything through your body. One must \\nremember at all times that all battles are His, not ours. The will and \\npower of God do everything.\\nKill all these great warriors who are already killed by Me. Do \\nnot fear. You will certainly conquer the enemies in the battle; therefore, fight! (11.34) \\nArjuna’s prayers to the Cosmic form\\nSanjaya said: Having heard these words of Krishna, the \\ncrowned Arjuna, trembling with folded hands, prostrated with fear \\nand spoke to Krishna in a choked voice. (11.35) Arjuna said: \\nRightly, O Krishna, the world delights and rejoices in glorifying You. \\nTerrified demons flee in all directions. The hosts of perfected ones \\nbow to You in adoration. (11.36) Why should they not — O great \\nsoul — bow to You, the original creator who is even greater than \\nBrahma, the creator of material worlds? O infinite Lord, O God of \\nall celestial rulers, O abode of the universe, You are both Sat (eternal) and Asat (temporal), and the Supreme Being that is beyond \\nboth Sat and Asat. (11.37) \\nYou are the primal God, the most ancient Person. You are the \\nultimate resort of all the universe. You are the knower, the object \\nof knowledge, and the supreme abode. The entire universe is pervaded by You, O Lord of the infinite form. (11.38) You are the controller of death, the fire, the wind, the water god, the moon god, and \\nBrahma, the creator, as well as the father of Brahma. Salutations \\nto You a thousand times, and again and again salutations to You. \\n(11.39) My salutations to You from front and from behind. O Lord, \\nmy obeisance to You from all sides. You are infinite valor and \\nboundless might. You pervade everything; therefore, You are everywhere and in everything. (11.40) \\nConsidering You merely as a friend, and not knowing Your \\ngreatness, I have inadvertently addressed You as O Krishna, O \\nYadava, O friend, etc., merely out of affection or carelessness. \\n(11.41) In whatever way I may have insulted You in jokes while \\nplaying, reposing in bed, sitting, or at meals; when alone or in front \\nof others, O Krishna, the immeasurable One, I implore You for forgiveness. (11.42) You are the father of this animate and inanimate \\nworld, and the greatest Guru to be worshipped. No one is even \\nequal to You in the three worlds; how can there be one greater than \\nYou, O Being of incomparable glory? (11.43)\\nTherefore, O adorable Lord, I seek Your mercy by bowing down \\nand prostrating my body before You. Bear with me as a father to \\nhis son, as a friend to a friend, and as a husband to his wife, O \\nLord. (11.44) I am delighted by beholding that which has never \\n\\n\\nbeen seen before, and yet my mind is tormented with fear. Therefore, O God of celestial rulers, the refuge of the universe, have\\nmercy on me and show me Your four-armed form. (11.45)\\nOne may see God in any form \\nI wish to see You with a crown, holding mace and discus in \\nYour hand. Therefore, O Lord, with thousand arms and universal \\nform, please appear in the four-armed form. (11.46) The Supreme \\nLord said: O Arjuna, being pleased with you I have shown you —\\nthrough My own yogic powers — this particular, supreme, shining, \\nuniversal, infinite, and primal form of Mine that has never been \\nseen before by anyone other than you. (11.47) O Arjuna, neither \\n\\nby study of the Vedas, nor by sacrifice, nor by charity, nor by rituals, nor by severe austerities, can I be seen in this cosmic form by \\nanyone other than you in this human world. (11.48) \\nDo not be perturbed and confused by seeing such a terrible form \\nof Mine as this. With fearless and cheerful mind, now behold My \\nfour-armed form. (11.49) Sanjaya said: After speaking like this to \\nArjuna, Lord Krishna revealed His four-armed form. And then assuming His pleasant human form, Lord Krishna, the Great One, \\nconsoled Arjuna who was terrified. (11.50) Arjuna said: O Krishna, \\nseeing this lovely human form of Yours, I have now become tranquil and I am normal again. (11.51) \\nGod can be seen by devotional love\\nThe Supreme Lord said: This (four-armed) form of Mine that \\nyou have seen is very difficult, indeed, to see. Even celestial controllers are ever longing to see this form. (11.52) This four-armed \\nform of Mine that you have just seen cannot be seen even by study \\nof the Vedas, or by austerity, or by acts of charity, or by the performance of rituals. (11.53) However, through single-minded devotion \\nalone, I can be seen in this form, can be known in essence, and \\nalso can be reached, O Arjuna. (11.54) One who dedicates all \\nworks to Me, and to whom I am the supreme goal, who is my devotee, who has no attachment, and is free from enmity towards any \\nbeing — attains Me, O Arjuna. (11.55)\\nCHAPTER 12\\n12. Path of devotion\\nWorship a personal or impersonal God?\\nArjuna said: Which of these has the best knowledge of yoga —\\nthose ever-steadfast devotees who worship You as Krishna, Your \\npersonal aspect, or those who worship Your impersonal aspect, \\nthe Eternal Being? (12.01) The Supreme Lord said: I consider the \\nbest yogis to be those ever-steadfast devotees who worship with \\nsupreme faith by fixing their mind on Me as their personal god. \\n(12.02) They also attain Me who worship the unchangeable, the \\ninexplicable, the invisible, the omnipresent, the inconceivable, the \\nunchanging, and the immovable Eternal Being; restraining all the \\nsenses, even minded under all circumstances, and engaged in the \\nwelfare of all creatures. (12.03-04)\\nReasons for worshipping a personal God\\nSelf-realization is more difficult for those who fix their mind on \\nthe impersonal, unmanifest, Eternal Being because comprehension of the unmanifest by human beings is attained with difficulty. \\n(12.05) But for those who worship Me with unswerving devotion as \\ntheir personal god, offer all actions to Me, intent on Me as the Supreme, and meditate on Me; I swiftly become their savior — from \\nthe world that is the ocean of death and transmigration — whose \\nthoughts are set on My personal form, O Arjuna. (12.06-07)\\nThe four paths to God\\nTherefore, focus your mind on Me, and let your intellect dwell \\nupon Me through meditation and contemplation. Thereafter, you \\nshall certainly attain Me. (12.08) If you are unable to focus your \\nmind steadily on Me, then long to attain Me, O Arjuna, by practice \\nof any other spiritual discipline that suits you. (12.09) If you are \\nunable even to do any spiritual discipline, then be intent on performing all your duty for Me. You shall attain perfection just by \\nworking for Me as an instrument, just to serve and please Me, without selfish motives. (12.10) If you are unable to work for Me, then \\njust surrender unto My will and renounce the attachment to and \\nanxiety for the fruits of all work with subdued mind — by learning \\nto accept all results, as God\\'s grace. (12.11)\\nKarma-yoga is the best Path\\nThe knowledge of scriptures is better than mere ritualistic practice; meditation is better than scriptural knowledge; renunciation of \\nattachment to the fruits of all work is better than meditation; peace \\nimmediately follows renunciation. (See more on renunciation in \\n18.02, 18.09) (12.12)\\nThe attributes of a devotee\\nOne who does not hate any creature, who is friendly and compassionate, free from the notion of \"I\" and \"my\", even-minded in \\npain and pleasure, forgiving; and the yogi who is ever content, who \\nhas subdued the mind, whose resolve is firm, whose mind and intellect are engaged in dwelling upon Me, who is devoted to Me —\\nis dear to Me. (12.13-14) The one by whom others are not agitated \\nand who is not agitated by others, who is free from joy, envy, fear, \\nand anxiety is also dear to Me. (12.15) One who is desireless, pure, \\nwise, impartial, and free from anxiety; who has renounced the doership in all undertakings—such a devotee is dear to Me. (12.16) \\nOne who neither rejoices nor grieves, neither likes nor dislikes, \\nwho has renounced both the good and the evil, and is full of devotion—is dear to Me. (12.17) The one who remains the \\n\\nsame towards friend or foe, in honor or disgrace, in heat or cold, in pleasure \\nor pain; who is free from attachment; who is indifferent to censure \\nor praise, quiet, content with whatever one has, unattached to a \\nplace, a country, or a house; calm, and full of devotion — that person is dear to Me. (12.18-19)\\nOne should sincerely try to develop divine qualities \\nBut those faithful devotees are very dear to Me who set Me as \\ntheir supreme goal and follow—or just sincerely try to develop—\\nthe above mentioned nectar of moral values. (12.20)\\nCHAPTER 13\\n13. Creation and the creator\\n\\nThe theory of creation\\nThe Supreme Lord said: O Arjuna, this physical body, a miniature universe, may be called the creation. One who knows the creation is called the creator by the seers of truth. (13.01) O Arjuna, \\nknow Me to be the creator of all the creation. The true understanding of both the creator and the creation is considered by Me to be \\nthe spiritual or metaphysical knowledge. (13.02) What the creation \\nis, what it’s like, what its transformations are, where its source is, \\nwho that creator is, and what His powers are — hear all these from \\nMe in brief. (13.03) The seers have separately described the creation and the creator in different ways in the Vedic hymns, and also \\nin the conclusive and convincing verses of the Brahma-Sutra. \\n(13.04) The primary material Nature, cosmic intellect, \"I\" consciousness or ego, five basic elements, ten organs, mind, five \\nsense objects; and desire, hatred, pleasure, pain, the physical \\nbody, consciousness, and resolve — thus the entire field has been \\nbriefly described with its transformations. (13.05-06) \\nThe fourfold noble truth as means of Nirvana\\nHumility, modesty, nonviolence, forgiveness, honesty, service \\nto guru, purity of thought, word, and deed, steadfastness, self-control; and aversion towards sense objects, absence of ego; constant \\nreflection on pain and suffering inherent in birth, old age, disease, \\nand death; (13.07-08) detached attachment with family members, \\nhome, etc.; unfailing calmness upon attainment of the desirable \\nand the undesirable; and unswerving devotion to Me through single-minded contemplation, taste for solitude, distaste for social \\ngatherings and gossips; steadfastness in acquiring the knowledge \\nof Eternal Being, and seeing the omnipresent Supreme Being everywhere — this is said to be knowledge. That which is contrary to \\nthis is ignorance. (13.09-11)\\nGod can be described by parables only\\nI shall fully describe the object of knowledge — knowing which \\none attains immortality. The beginningless Supreme Being is said \\nto be neither eternal (Sat) nor temporal (Asat). (13.12) The Eternal \\nBeing has His hands, feet, eyes, head, mouth, and ears everywhere, because He is all-pervading and omnipresent. (13.13) He \\nis the perceiver of all sense objects without the physical sense organs; unattached, and yet the sustainer of all; devoid of three \\nmodes of material Nature, and yet the enjoyer of the modes of material Nature by becoming a living entity. (13.14) He is inside as \\nwell as outside all beings, animate and inanimate. He is incomprehensible because of His subtlety. And because of His omnipresence, He is very near, residing in one’s inner psyche, as well as far \\naway in His Supreme Abode. (13.15) He is undivided, and yet appears to exist as if divided in beings. He, the object of knowledge, \\nappears as: Brahma, the creator; Vishnu, the sustainer; and Shiva, \\nthe destroyer of all beings. (13.16) \\nThe Supreme Person is the source of all light. He is said to be \\nbeyond darkness of ignorance. He is the Self-knowledge, the object of Self-knowledge, and seated in the inner psyche as consciousness of all beings. He is to be realized by Self-knowledge. \\n(13.17) Thus, the creation as well as the knowledge and the object \\nof knowledge have been briefly described by Me. Understanding \\nthis, My devotee attains the supreme abode. (13.18)\\nA description of the supreme spirit, spirit, and jiva\\nKnow that both the material Nature and the Spiritual Being are \\nbeginningless. All manifestations and three states of mind and matter, called modes or Gunas, are born of Prakriti. Prakriti is said to \\nbe the cause of production of the physical body and the eleven \\norgans of perception and action. Purusha (Consciousness, Spirit) \\nis said to be the cause of experiencing pleasure and pain. (13.19-\\n20) Purusha enjoys three modes of material Nature (Prakriti) by \\nassociating with Prakriti. Attachment to the Gunas due to ignorance caused by previous Karma is the cause of birth of living entity\\n(jiva) in good and evil wombs. (13.21) \\nEternal Being (God, Spirit) in the body is also called the witness, \\nthe guide, the supporter, the enjoyer, the great Lord, and also the \\nSupreme Self. (13.22) They who truly understand Spiritual Being \\n(Purusha) and the material Nature (Prakriti) with its three modes \\n(Gunas) are not born again, regardless of their way of life. (13.23) \\nSome perceive the supersoul in their inner psyche through mind \\nand intellect that have been purified either by meditation or by metaphysical knowledge or by Karma-yoga. (13.24) \\nThe faith alone can lead to Nirvana\\nOthers, however, do not know the yoga of meditation, \\nknowledge, and work; but they perform deity worship with faith, as \\nmentioned in the scriptures by the saints and sages. They also \\ntranscend death by virtue of their firm faith in what they have heard. \\n(13.25) Whatever is born, animate or inanimate, know them to be \\n\\n\\nborn from the union of the matter and Spirit, O Arjuna. (13.26) \\nThe one who sees the same eternal Supreme Lord dwelling as \\nSpirit equally within all mortal beings, truly sees. (13.27) Because \\nof beholding one and the same Lord existing equally in every being, one does not injure anybody and thereupon attains the supreme abode. (13.28) One who perceives that all works are done \\nby the powers (Gunas) of material Nature (Prakriti) alone, and thus \\ndoes not consider oneself as the doer, that person truly understands. (13.29) The moment one discovers the diverse variety of \\nbeings and their ideas abiding in the Source and coming out from \\nHim alone, one attains the Supreme Being. (13.30)\\nAttributes of the spirit \\n\\nBecause of being beginningless and unaffectable by the three \\nmodes of material Nature, the eternal supersoul — even though \\ndwelling in the body as a living entity — neither does anything nor \\nbecomes tainted, O Arjuna. (13.31) Just as the all-pervading space \\nis not tainted because of its subtlety; similarly, Spirit, abiding in all \\nbodies, is not tainted. (13.32) Just as one sun illuminates the entire \\nworld; similarly, Eternal Being illumines or gives life to the entire \\ncreation, O Arjuna. (13.33) \\nThey attain the Supreme, who perceive the difference between \\nbody and spirit with the eye of Self-knowledge, and know the techniques — by using any one of the five paths: Selfless service, \\nKnowledge, Devotion, Meditation, and Surrender — of liberation of \\nthe living entity (Jiva) from the trap of divine illusory energy (Maya). \\n(13.34)\\nCHAPTER 14\\n14. Three modes (Gunas) of nature\\nThe Supreme Lord said: I shall further explain to you that supreme knowledge, the best of all knowledge, knowing which all the \\nsages have attained supreme perfection after this life. (14.01) They \\nwho have taken refuge in this spiritual knowledge attain unity with \\nMe and are neither born at the time of creation, nor afflicted at the \\ntime of dissolution. (14.02) \\nBeings are born from the union of spirit and matter\\nMy material Nature is the womb of creation wherein I place the \\nseed of consciousness from which all beings are born, O Arjuna. \\n(14.03) Whatever forms are produced in all different wombs, O Arjuna, the material Nature is their body-giving mother; and I am the \\nlife-giving father. (14.04)\\nHow three modes of material nature bind us\\nSattva or goodness; Rajas or passion, activity; and Tamas or \\nignorance, inertia — these three modes (Ropes, Gunas) of material Nature (Prakriti) fetter the eternal individual soul to the body, O \\nArjuna. (14.05) Of these, the mode of goodness is illuminating and \\ngood because it is pure. It fetters the living entity by attachment to \\nhappiness and knowledge, O sinless Arjuna. (14.06) Know that the \\nmode of passion is characterized by intense craving and is the \\nsource of desire and attachment. It binds the living entity by attachment to the fruits of work. (14.07) Know, O Arjuna, that the mode \\nof ignorance — the deluder of living entity — is born of inertia. It \\nbinds the living entity by carelessness, laziness, and excessive \\nsleep. (14.08) O Arjuna, the mode of goodness attaches one to \\nhappiness (of learning and knowing the Eternal Being); the mode \\nof passion attaches to intense action; and the mode of ignorance \\nattaches to inaction, laziness by covering Self-knowledge. (14.09) \\nCharacteristics of three modes of nature\\nGoodness prevails by suppressing passion and ignorance; \\npassion prevails by suppressing goodness and ignorance; and ignorance prevails by suppressing goodness and passion, O Arjuna. \\n(14.10) When the light of Self-knowledge illuminates all the senses \\nin the body, then it should be known that goodness is predominant. \\n(14.11) O Arjuna, when passion is predominant, greed, activity, undertaking of selfish work, restlessness, excitement, etc. arise. \\n(14.12) O Arjuna, when inertia is predominant, ignorance, inactivity, carelessness, delusion, etc. arise. (14.13) \\nThree modes are also the vehicles of transmigration \\nOne who dies when goodness dominates goes to heaven —\\nthe pure world of knowers of the Supreme. (14.14) One who dies \\nwhen passion dominates is reborn attached to action or the utilitarian type. One who dies in ignorance is reborn as a lower creature. \\n(14.15) The fruit of good action is said to be beneficial and pure; \\nthe fruit of passionate action is pain; and the fruit of ignorant action \\nis laziness. (14.16) Self-knowledge arises from the mode of goodness; greed arises from the mode of passion; and negligence, delusion, and slowness of mind arise from the mode of ignorance. \\n(14.17) They who are established in goodness go to heaven; passionate persons are reborn in the mortal world; and the ignorant, \\nabiding in the lowest mode of ignorance, go to lower planets or hell \\n(or take birth as lower creatures). (14.18)\\nAttain Nirvana after rising above three modes \\nWhen visionaries perceive no doer other than the three modes \\nof material Nature and know the Supreme, which is above and beyond these modes, then they attain salvation (Mukti). (14.19) When\\none rises above the three modes of material Nature that originate \\nin the body, one attains immortality or salvation (Mukti) and is freed \\nfrom the pains of birth, old age, and death. (14.20)\\nThe process of rising above three modes\\nArjuna said: What are the marks of those who have transcended the three modes of material Nature, and what is their \\n\\nconduct? How does one transcend these three modes of material Nature, O Lord Krishna? (14.21) The Supreme Lord said: One is said \\nto have transcended the modes of material Nature who neither \\nhates the presence of enlightenment, activity, and delusion; nor \\ndesires for them when they are absent; who remains like a witness \\nwithout being affected by the modes of material Nature; who stays \\nfirmly attached to the Lord without wavering — thinking that only \\nthe modes of material Nature are operating. (14.22-23) And one \\nwho depends on the Lord and is indifferent to pain and pleasure; \\nto whom a clod, a stone, and gold are alike; to whom the dear and \\nthe unfriendly are alike; who is of firm mind; who is calm in censure \\n\\nand in praise, and indifferent to honor and disgrace; who is impartial to friend and foe; and who has given up the sense of doership\\nand ownership. (14.24-25)\\nBonds of three modes can be cut by devotional love\\nOne who offers service to Me with love and unswerving devotion, rises above three modes of material Nature and becomes fit \\nfor Nirvana. (14.26) Because I am the basis of the immortal Eternal \\nBeing, of everlasting order (Dharma), and of the absolute bliss. \\n(14.27)\\nCHAPTER 15\\n15. The supreme being\\nCreation is like a tree created by of Maya\\nThe Supreme Lord said: Sages speak of the eternal banyan \\ntree that has its origin (or root) above in the Supreme Being and \\nbranches below in the cosmos, and whose leaves are the Vedic \\nhymns. One who understands this tree is a knower of the Vedas. \\n(15.01) The branches of this cosmic tree of Maya (Illusion) spread \\nall over the cosmos. The tree is nourished by three modes of material Nature; sense pleasures are its sprouts; and its roots of ego, \\nattachment and desire stretch below in the human world, causing \\nKarmic bondage. (15.02) \\nCut the tree of attachment to attain salvation\\nThe real form of this tree is not perceptible here on earth, nor \\nis its beginning, end, or existence. Having cut the firm roots — the \\nego and desires — of this tree by the mighty ax of Self-knowledge \\nand detachment; thus thinking: \"I take refuge in that very primal \\nperson from whom this primal manifestation comes forth\", seek \\nthat supreme abode from where one does not come back to the \\nmortal world again. (15.03-04) The wise reach that eternal goal, \\nwho are free from pride and delusion, who have conquered the evil \\nof attachment, who constantly dwell in the Supreme Self with all \\ndesires completely stilled, and who are free from dualities of pleasure and pain. (15.05) The sun does not illumine My supreme \\nabode, nor does the moon, nor the fire. Having reached there people attain permanent liberation (Mukti) and do not come back to \\nthis temporal world again. (15.06) \\nThe embodied soul is the enjoyer\\nThe eternal individual soul in the body of living beings is, indeed, My integral part. It associates with the six sensory faculties \\nof perception — including the mind — and activates them. (15.07) \\nJust as the air takes aroma away from the flower; similarly, the individual soul takes the six sensory faculties from the physical body \\nit casts off during death to the new physical body it acquires in reincarnation by the power of Karma. (15.08) The living entity (Jiva) \\nenjoys sense pleasures using six sensory faculties of hearing, \\ntouch, sight, taste, smell, and mind. The ignorant cannot perceive \\nJiva departing from the body, nor staying in the body and enjoying \\nsense pleasures by associating with the modes of material Nature. \\nBut those who have the eye of Self-knowledge can see it. (15.09-\\n10) The yogis, striving for perfection, behold the living entity (Jiva) \\nabiding in their inner psyche as consciousness, but the ignorant \\nand those whose inner psyche is not pure, even though striving, \\ndo not perceive Him. (15.11)\\nSpirit is the essence of everything\\nKnow that light energy to be Mine that comes from the sun and \\nillumines the whole world and is in the moon and in fire. (15.12) \\nNOTE: The light of the sun is a reflection of His radiance (RV \\n10.07.03). The knowers of the Supreme Being visualize \\neverywhere — in themselves, in every human being, and in the \\nwhole universe — that supreme cluster of light which is the source \\nof the visible world. \\nEntering the earth, I support all beings with My energy. Becoming the sap-giving moon, I nourish all the plants. (15.13) Becoming \\nthe digestive fire, I remain in the body of all living beings. Uniting \\nwith vital life forces, I digest all types of food. (15.14) And I am \\nseated in the inner psyche of all beings. Memory, Self-knowledge, \\nand removal of doubts and wrong notions (about the Eternal Being \\nby reasoning or in trance (Samadhi)) come from Me. I am to be \\nknown by the study of all the Vedas. I am, indeed, the author of the \\nVedanta and the knower of the Vedas. (15.15)\\nSupreme spirit, spirit and the created beings\\nThere are two entities in the cosmos: The temporal Divine Beings and the unchangeable Eternal Being. All created beings are \\nsubject to change, but the Eternal Being does not change. (15.16) \\nThe Supreme Being is beyond both the Temporal Divine Beings \\nand the Eternal Being. He is also called the Absolute, Reality, God, \\n\\n\\nthe Source, who sustains both the Temporal and the Eternal by \\npervading everything. (15.17) Because I am beyond both the Temporal and the Eternal, therefore I am known in this world and in the \\nVedas as the Supreme Being. (15.18) The wise, who truly understand Me as the Supreme Being, know everything and worship Me \\nwholeheartedly, O Arjuna. (15.19) Thus, I have explained this most \\nsecret science of Self-knowledge, O sinless Arjuna. Having understood this, one becomes enlightened; one’s all duties are accomplished; and the goal of human life is achieved, O Arjuna. (15.20) \\nCHAPTER 16\\n16. Divine and the demonic qualities\\nA list of divine qualities to be cultivated\\n\\nThe Supreme Lord said: Fearlessness, purity of the inner psyche, perseverance in the yoga of Self-knowledge, charity, senserestraint, sacrifice, study of the scriptures, austerity, honesty; nonviolence, truthfulness, absence of anger, renunciation, calmness, \\nabstinence from malicious talk, compassion for all creatures, freedom from greed, gentleness, modesty, absence of fickleness, \\nsplendor, forgiveness, fortitude, cleanliness, absence of malice, \\nand absence of pride — these are the (twenty-six) qualities of \\nthose endowed with divine virtues, O Arjuna. (16.01-03)\\nA list of demonic qualities to be given up\\nO Arjuna, the marks of those who are born with demonic qualities are: Hypocrisy, arrogance, pride, anger, harshness, and ignorance. (16.04) Divine qualities lead to salvation (Moksha); the demonic qualities are said to be for bondage. Do not grieve, O Arjuna; \\nyou are born with divine qualities. (16.05) \\nThere are only two types of human beings\\nBasically, there are only two types of human beings in this \\nworld: The divine, and the demonic. The divine has been described \\nat length. Now hear from Me about the demonic, O Arjuna. (16.06) \\nPersons of demonic nature do not know what to do and what not \\nto do. They have neither purity nor good conduct nor truthfulness. \\n(16.07) They say that the world is unreal, without a substratum, \\nwithout God, and without an order. The world is caused by sexual \\nunion of man and woman alone and nothing else. (16.08) Adhering \\nto this wrong, atheistic view, these degraded souls — with small \\nintellect and cruel deeds — are born as enemies for the destruction \\nof the world. (16.09) Filled with insatiable desires, hypocrisy, pride, \\nand arrogance; holding wrong views due to delusion; they act with \\nimpure motives, (16.10) obsessed with endless anxiety lasting until \\ndeath, considering sense gratification their highest aim, and convinced that sense pleasure is everything; (16.11) \\nBound by hundreds of ties of desire and enslaved by lust and \\nanger, they strive to obtain wealth by unlawful means to fulfill sensual pleasures. They think: (16.12) This has been gained by me \\ntoday; I shall fulfill this desire; I have this much wealth and will have \\nmore wealth in the future; (16.13) that enemy has been slain by \\nme, and I shall slay others also. I am the lord. I am the enjoyer. I \\nam successful, powerful, and happy; (16.14)\\nI am rich and born in a noble family. Who is equal to me? I shall \\nperform sacrifice, I shall give charity, and I shall rejoice. (16.15) \\nThus deluded by ignorance, bewildered by many fancies, entangled in the net of delusion, addicted to the enjoyment of sensual \\npleasures, they fall into a foul hell. (16.16) Self-conceited, stubborn, filled with pride and intoxication of wealth, they perform sacrifice, charity, etc. only in name for show, and not according to \\nscriptural injunction. (16.17) These malicious people cling to egoism, power, arrogance, lust, anger, greed, hatred; and they deny \\nMy presence in their own body and in others’ bodies. (16.18) \\nSuffering is the destiny of the ignorant\\nI hurl these haters, cruel, sinful, and mean people into the cycles of rebirth in the womb of demons again and again. (16.19) O \\nArjuna, entering the wombs of demons, birth after birth, the deluded ones sink to the lowest hell without ever attaining Me. (16.20)\\nLust, anger, and greed are the three gates to hell\\nLust, anger, and greed are the three gates of hell leading to the \\nbondage of the individual. Therefore, one must learn to give up \\nthese three. (16.21) One who is liberated from these three gates of \\nhell, O Arjuna, does what is best and consequently attains the supreme abode. (16.22) \\nOne must follow the scripture\\nOne who acts under the influence of one’s desires, disobeying \\nscriptural injunctions, neither attains perfection nor happiness nor \\nthe supreme abode. (16.23) Therefore, let the scripture be your \\nauthority in determining what should be done and what should not \\nbe done. You should perform your duty following the scriptural injunction. (16.24) \\nCHAPTER 17\\n17. Threefold faith\\nArjuna said: What is the mode of devotion of those who perform \\nspiritual practices with faith, but without following the scriptural injunctions, O Krishna? Is it in the mode of goodness, passion, or \\nignorance? (17.01) \\nThree types of faith\\nThe Supreme Lord said: The natural faith of embodied beings \\nis of three kinds: Goodness, passion, and ignorance. Now hear \\nabout these from Me. (17.02) O Arjuna, the faith of each is in accordance with one’s own natural disposition governed by Karmic \\nimpressions. One is known by one’s faith. One can become whatever one wants to be — if one constantly contemplates the object \\nof desire with faith. (17.03) Persons in the mode of goodness worship celestial controllers; those in the mode of \\n\\npassion worship supernatural rulers and demons; and those in the mode of ignorance \\nworship ghosts and spirits. (17.04) Ignorant persons of demonic \\nnature are those who practice severe austerities without following \\nthe prescription of the scriptures, who are full of hypocrisy and egotism, who are impelled by the force of desire and attachment, and \\nwho senselessly torture the elements in their body and also Me \\nwho dwells within the body. (17.05-06)\\nThree types of food\\nThe food preferred by all of us is also of three types. So are the \\nsacrifice, austerity, and charity. Now hear the distinction between \\n\\nthem. (17.07) The foods that promote longevity, virtue, strength, \\nhealth, happiness, and joy are juicy, smooth, substantial, and nutritious. Such foods are liked by persons in the mode of goodness. \\n(17.08) People in the mode of passion like foods that are very bitter, sour, salty, hot, pungent, dry, and burning; and cause pain, \\ngrief, and disease. (17.09) People in the mode of ignorance like \\nfoods that are stale, tasteless, putrid, rotten, refuse, impure, such \\nas meat and alcohol. (17.10)\\nThree types of sacrifices\\nSelfless service — enjoined by the scriptures and performed \\nwithout a desire for the fruit, with a firm belief and conviction that it \\nis one’s duty — is in the mode of goodness. (17.11) Selfless service that is performed only for show and aiming for fruit — is in the \\nmode of passion, O Arjuna. (17.12) Selfless service that is performed without following the scripture, in which no food is distributed, which is devoid of mantra, faith, and gift, is said to be in the \\nmode of ignorance. (17.13)\\nAusterity of thought, word, and deed\\nThe worship of celestial controllers, the priest, the guru, and \\nthe wise; purity, honesty, celibacy, and nonviolence — these are \\nsaid to be austerity of deed. (17.14) Speech that is non-offensive, \\ntruthful, pleasant, beneficial, and is used for the regular study of \\nscriptures is called the austerity of word. (17.15) Serenity of mind, \\ngentleness, calmness, self-control, and purity of thought — these \\nare called austerity of thought. (17.16) \\nThree types of austerity\\nThe above mentioned threefold austerity — of thought, word, \\nand deed — practiced by yogis with supreme faith, without a desire \\nfor the fruit, is said to be in the mode of goodness. (17.17) Austerity \\nthat is performed for gaining respect, honor, reverence, and for the \\nsake of show, yielding an uncertain and temporary result, is said to \\nbe in the mode of passion. (17.18) Austerity performed with foolish \\nstubbornness or with self-torture or for harming others, is said to \\nbe in the mode of ignorance. (17.19)\\nThree types of charity\\nCharity that is given at the right place and time as a matter of \\nduty to a deserving candidate who does nothing in return, is considered to be in the mode of goodness. (17.20) Charity that is given \\nunwillingly, or to get something in return, or to gain some fruit, is \\nsaid to be in the mode of passion. (17.21) Charity that is given at a \\nwrong place and time to unworthy persons, or without paying respect to the receiver or with ridicule, is said to be in the mode of \\nignorance. (17.22)\\nThreefold name of God\\n‘OM TAT SAT’ is said to be the threefold name of God in Sanskrit. Persons with good qualities, the Vedas, and selfless service \\nwere created by God in the ancient time. (17.23) Therefore, acts of \\nsacrifice, charity, and austerity prescribed in the scriptures are always commenced by uttering ‘OM’ by the knowers of the Supreme \\nBeing. (17.24) Various types of sacrifice, charity, and austerity are \\nperformed by the seekers of salvation by uttering ‘TAT’ (or He is \\nall) without seeking a reward. (17.25) The word ‘SAT’ is used in the \\nsense of Reality and goodness. The word ‘SAT’ is also used for an \\nauspicious act, O Arjuna. (17.26) Faith in sacrifice, charity, and \\nausterity is also called ‘SAT’. Selfless service for the sake of the \\nSupreme is, in truth, termed as ‘SAT’. (17.27) Whatever is done \\nwithout faith — whether it is sacrifice, charity, austerity, or any \\nother act — is called ‘ASAT’. It has no value here or hereafter, O \\nArjuna. (17.28)\\nCHAPTER 18\\n18. Attaining liberation by giving up ego\\nArjuna said: I wish to know the nature of renunciation \\n(Samnyasa) and sacrifice (Tyaga) and the difference between the \\ntwo, O Lord Krishna. (18.01) \\nDefinition of renunciation and sacrifice\\nThe Supreme Lord said: The sages call renunciation the complete renunciation of work for any personal profit. The wise define \\nsacrifice as the sacrifice of, and the freedom from, attachment to \\nthe fruits of all work. (18.02) Some philosophers say that all work \\nis full of faults and should be given up, while others say that acts \\nof sacrifice, charity, and austerity should not be abandoned. \\n(18.03) \\nO Arjuna, listen to My conclusion about sacrifice. Sacrifice is \\nsaid to be of three types. (18.04) Acts of service, charity, and austerity should not be abandoned, but should be performed, because \\nservice, charity, and austerity are the purifiers of the wise. (18.05) \\nEven these obligatory works should be performed without attachment to the fruits. This is My definite supreme advice, O Arjuna.\\n(18.06) \\n\\n\\nThree types of sacrifice\\nGiving up one\\'s duty is not proper. The abandonment of obligatory work is due to delusion and is declared to be in the mode of \\nignorance. (18.07) One who abandons duty merely because it is \\ndifficult or because of fear of bodily affliction, does not get the benefits of sacrifice by performing such a sacrifice in the mode of passion. (18.08) Obligatory work performed as duty, renouncing attachment to the fruit, is alone to be regarded as sacrifice in the \\nmode of goodness, O Arjuna. (18.09) One who neither hates a disagreeable work, nor is attached to an agreeable work, is considered a sacrificer (Tyagi), imbued with the mode of goodness, intelligent, and free from all doubts about the Supreme Being. (18.10) \\nHuman beings cannot completely abstain from work. Therefore, \\n\\none who completely renounces attachment to the fruits of all work \\nis considered a Tyagi. (18.11) The threefold fruit of works — desirable, undesirable, and mixed — accrues after death to the one who \\nis not a Tyagi, but never to a Tyagi. (18.12)\\nFive causes of an action\\nLearn from Me, O Arjuna, the five causes, as described in the \\nSamkhya doctrine, for the accomplishment of all actions. They are: \\nthe physical body, the seat of Karma; the modes of material Nature, the doer; the eleven organs of perception and action, the instruments; various life forces; and the fifth is one’s fate. (18.13-14) \\nThese are the five causes of whatever action, whether right or \\nwrong, one performs by thought, word and deed. (18.15) Therefore, the ignorant, who consider one’s body or the soul as the sole \\nagent, do not understand due to imperfect knowledge. (18.16) One \\nwho is free from the notion of doership and whose intellect is not \\npolluted by the desire to reap the fruit — even after slaying all these \\npeople — neither slays nor is bound by the act of killing. (18.17) \\nThe subject, the object, and the knowledge of the object are the \\nthreefold driving force (or impetus) to an action. The eleven organs \\nof perception and action, the act, and the modes of Nature are the \\nthree components of action. (18.18)\\nThree types of spiritual knowledge\\nSelf-knowledge, action, and agent are said to be of three types, \\naccording to the Guna theory. Hear duly about these also. (18.19) \\nThe knowledge by which one sees a single immutable Reality in all \\nbeings as undivided in the divided, such knowledge is in the mode \\nof goodness. (18.20) The knowledge by which one sees different \\nrealities of various types among all beings as separate from one \\nanother; such knowledge is in the mode of passion. (18.21) The \\nirrational, baseless, and worthless knowledge by which one clings \\nto one single effect, such as the body, as if it is everything, such \\nknowledge is declared to be in the mode of darkness or ignorance \\n(18.22)\\nThree types of action\\nObligatory duty, performed without likes and dislikes and without selfish motives and attachment to enjoy the fruit, is said to be \\nin the mode of goodness. (18.23) Action performed with ego, with \\nselfish motives, and with too much effort, is in the mode of passion. \\n(18.24) Action that is undertaken because of delusion, disregarding consequences, loss, injury to others, as well as one’s own ability, is said to be in the mode of ignorance. (18.25)\\nThree types of person\\nA person who is free from attachment, is non-egotistic, endowed with resolve and enthusiasm, and unperturbed in success \\nor failure, is called good. (18.26) A person who is impassioned, \\nwho desires the fruits of work, who is greedy, violent, impure, and \\ngets affected by joy and sorrow, is called passionate. (18.27) A \\nperson who is undisciplined, vulgar, stubborn, wicked, malicious, \\nlazy, depressed, and procrastinating, is called ignorant. (18.28)\\nThree types of intellect\\nNow hear Me explain fully and separately, O Arjuna, the threefold division of intellect and resolve, based on modes of material \\nNature. (18.29) O Arjuna, that intellect is in the mode of goodness \\nwhich understands the path of work and the path of renunciation, \\nright and wrong action, fear and fearlessness, bondage and liberation. (18.30) That intellect is in the mode of passion which cannot \\ndistinguish between righteousness and unrighteousness, and right \\nand wrong action, O Arjuna. (18.31) That intellect is in the mode of \\nignorance which, when covered by ignorance, accepts unrighteousness as righteousness and thinks everything to be that which \\nit is not, O Arjuna. (18.32) \\nThree types of resolve, four goals of human life\\nThat resolve is in the mode of goodness by which one manipulates the functions of the mind, Prana (bioimpulses, life forces) \\nand senses for God-realization only, O Arjuna. (18.33) That resolve \\nis in the mode of passion by which one, craving for the fruits of \\nwork, clings to duty, earning wealth, and pleasure with great attachment. (18.34) That resolve is in the mode of ignorance by \\nwhich a dull person does not give up sleep, fear, grief, despair, and \\ncarelessness, O Arjuna. (18.35)\\nThree types of pleasure\\nAnd now hear from Me, O Arjuna, about the threefold pleasure. \\nThe pleasure that one enjoys from spiritual practice results in cessation of all sorrows. (18.36) The pleasure that appears as poison \\nin the beginning, but is like nectar in the end, comes by the grace \\nof Self-knowledge and is in the mode of goodness. (18.37) Sensual \\npleasures that appear as nectars in the beginning, but become poison in the end, are in the mode of passion. (18.38) Pleasure that \\nconfuses a person in the beginning and in the end as a result of \\nsleep, laziness, and carelessness, is in the mode of ignorance. \\n(18.39) There is no being, either on the earth or among the celestial \\ncontrollers in the heaven, who can remain free from these three \\n\\n\\nmodes of material Nature. (18.40) \\nDivision of labor is based on one’s ability\\nThe division of labor into four categories is also based on the \\nqualities inherent in people’s nature and not necessarily as one’s \\nbirth right, O Arjuna. (18.41) Intellectuals who have serenity, selfcontrol, austerity, purity, patience, honesty, spiritual knowledge, \\nspiritual experience, and belief in God are labeled as intellectuals \\n(Brahmans). (18.42) Those having the qualities of heroism, vigor, \\nfirmness, dexterity, steadfastness in battle, charity, and administrative skills are called Kshatriyas or warriors. (18.43) Those who \\n\\nare good at cultivation, cattle rearing, business, trade, and industry \\nare known as Vaishyas (merchants). Those who are very good in \\nservice and labor type work are classed as laborers. (18.44)\\nAttain salvation by duty, discipline, devotion\\nOne can attain the highest perfection by devotion to one’s natural work. Listen to Me how one attains perfection while engaged \\nin one’s natural work. (18.45) One attains perfection by worshipping the Supreme Being—from whom all beings originate, and by \\nwhom all this universe is pervaded — through performance of \\none’s natural duty for Him. (18.46) One’s inferior natural work is \\nbetter than superior unnatural work even though well performed. \\nOne who does the work ordained by one’s inherent nature without \\nselfish motives incurs no sin or Karmic bondage. (18.47) One’s \\nnatural work, even though defective, should not be abandoned because all undertakings are enveloped by defects as fire is covered \\nby smoke, O Arjuna. (18.48) The person whose mind is always free \\nfrom attachment, who has subdued the mind and senses, and who \\nis free from desires, attains the supreme perfection of freedom \\nfrom the bondage of Karma by renouncing attachment to the fruits \\nof work. (18.49) \\nLearn from Me briefly, O Arjuna, how one who has attained such \\nperfection — the freedom from the bondage of Karma — attains \\nthe Supreme Person, the goal of spiritual knowledge. (18.50) Endowed with purified intellect, subduing the mind with firm resolve, \\nturning away from sound and other objects of the senses, giving \\nup likes and dislikes; living in solitude; eating lightly; controlling the \\nmind, speech, and organs of action; ever absorbed in yoga of meditation; taking refuge in detachment; and relinquishing egotism, violence, pride, lust, anger, and proprietorship — one becomes \\npeaceful, free from the notion of \"I” and “my\", and fit for attaining \\noneness with the Supreme Being. (18.51-53) Absorbed in the Supreme Being, the serene one neither grieves nor desires. Becoming impartial to all beings, one obtains My Para-Bhakti, the highest \\ndevotional love. (18.54) By devotion one truly understands what \\nand who I am in essence. Having known Me in essence, one immediately merges with Me. (18.55) \\nA Karma-yogi attains the eternal immutable abode, by My grace \\n— even while doing all duties — just by dedicating all action to Me \\nwith loving devotion. (18.56) Sincerely offer all actions to Me, set \\nMe as your supreme goal, and completely depend on Me. Always \\nfix your mind on Me and resort to Karma-yoga. (18.57) When your \\nmind becomes fixed on Me, you shall overcome all difficulties by \\nMy grace. But, if you do not listen to Me due to ego, you shall perish. (18.58)\\nKarmic bondage and the free will\\nIf due to ego you think: I shall not fight, your resolve is vain. \\nBecause your own nature will compel you to fight. (18.59) O Arjuna, you are controlled by your own nature-born Karmic impressions (or Samskara). Therefore, you shall do — even against your \\nwill — what you do not wish to do out of delusion. (18.60) The Supreme Lord, Krishna or God, abiding as the controller in the inner \\npsyche of all beings, O Arjuna, causes them to evolve — or work \\nout their Karma — like a puppet of Karma, mounted on a machine. \\n(18.61) \\nThe Supreme Controller is the reflection of the Supreme \\nSpirit in the body. The Supreme Lord organizes, controls, \\nsupervises, and directs everything in the universe. Human being is \\nlike a puppet of Karma mounted on a body which is the vehicle of \\ntransmigration. The word evolve refers to working out one’s Karma. \\nThus we become the puppet of our own Karma created by our free \\nwill. \\nThe Lord has made Karmic laws as the controller of all \\nliving beings. Therefore, one must learn to gladly endure all that \\nfate imposes by taking refuge in God and following His\\ncommandments. Vedas declare that the Lord, using His law of \\nKarma, makes us dance as a juggler would make his monkey \\ndance. Without the laws of Karma; the scriptural injunctions, \\nprohibitions, as well as self-effort, would have no value at all. \\nKarma is the eternal justice and the eternal law. As a result of the \\nworking of eternal justice, there can be no escape from the consequences of our deeds. We become the product of our own past \\nthinking and action. Therefore, we must think and act wisely at the \\npresent moment, using the scriptures as a guide. \\nThe doctrine of Karma and reincarnation is also found in \\nthe following two verses of the Koran: Allah is He who created you \\nand then sustained you, then causes you to die, then gives life to \\nyou again (Surah 30.40). He may reward those who believe and \\ndo good works. No one is able to escape His law of consequences \\n(Surah 30.45). People cannot escape from the consequences of \\ntheir deeds, for as we sow, so we reap. Cause and effect cannot \\n\\n\\nbe separated because the effect exists in the cause as the fruit \\nexists in the seed. Good and evil deeds follow us continually like \\nour shadows. \\nThe Bible also says: Whosoever shedeth man’s blood, by \\nman shall his blood be shed (Genesis 9.06). It is believed that all \\nreferences to Karma and reincarnation were taken out of the Bible \\nduring the second century with the noble aim of encouraging \\npeople to strive hard for perfection during this very life. Those who \\nbelieve in reincarnation must avoid laziness and procrastination, \\nstress intense spiritual discipline, and try their best to get Self-\\n\\nrealization in this very life as if there were no reincarnation. Live as \\nthough this is your last day on this earth. One cannot achieve \\nanything through laziness and procrastination. \\nSeek refuge in the Supreme Lord alone with loving devotion, O \\nArjuna. By His grace you shall attain supreme peace and the Eternal Abode. (18.62) Thus, I have explained the knowledge that is \\nmore secret than the secret. After fully reflecting on this, do as you \\nwish. (18.63) \\nPath of surrender is the ultimate path to God\\nHear once again My most secret, supreme word. You are very \\ndear to Me; therefore, I shall tell this for your benefit. (18.64) Fix \\nyour mind on Me, be devoted to Me, offer service to Me, bow down \\nto Me, and you shall certainly reach Me. I promise you, because \\nyou are My very dear friend. (18.65) Setting aside doership, ownership and attachment to the fruits of all works, just surrender to—\\nor gladly abide by— My Will. I shall liberate you from all sins or \\nbondage of Karma. Do not grieve. (18.66) \\nThe meaning of abandoning all duties and taking refuge in \\nGod is that one should perform duty without ego and attachment\\nto results; as an offering to the Lord, and totally depend only on \\nHim. The Lord takes full responsibility for a person who totally depends on Him and understands: All is manifestation of the One.\\nThe highest service to God, and the best charity\\nThis knowledge should never be spoken by you to one who is \\ndevoid of austerity, who is without devotion, who does not desire \\nto listen, or who speaks ill of Me. (18.67) \\nTo speak of wisdom to a deluded person, to glorify sacrifice to \\na greedy person, to advise sense control to an irascible person, \\nand to discourse on Lord Rama’s exploits to a lecher, is as useless \\nas sowing seed on barren ground. It is not for any soul to believe, \\nsave by the permission of Allah. You should not compel one to \\nbelieve (Surah 10.100-101). Anyone to whom Allah has not \\ngranted the light (of knowledge) will have no light (Surah 24.40).\\nThe study of Gita or any other scripture is meant only for sincere \\npersons. According to Ramakrishna, one can understand Him as \\nmuch as He makes one understand. Guru Nanak said: O Beloved; \\nonly they to whom You give the divine knowledge, obtain it.\\nThe one who shall propagate (or help the propagation of) this \\nsupreme secret philosophy of the Gita amongst devotees, shall be \\nperforming the highest devotional service to Me and shall certainly \\ncome to Me. (18.68) No other person shall do a more pleasing service to Me, and no one on the earth shall be dearer to Me. (18.69)\\nThe Grace of the Gita\\nThose who shall study our sacred dialogue shall be performing \\na holy act of knowledge-sacrifice. This is My promise. (18.70) Whoever hears or reads this sacred dialogue in the form of the Gita with \\nfaith and without cavil becomes free from sin, and attains heaven \\n— the higher worlds of those whose actions are pure and virtuous. \\n(18.71) O Arjuna, did you listen to this with single-minded attention? Has your delusion born of ignorance been completely destroyed? (18.72) Arjuna said: By Your Grace my delusion is destroyed; I have gained Self-knowledge; my confusion with regard \\nto body and Spirit is dispelled; and I shall obey Your command. \\n(18.73) \\nSanjaya said: Thus, I heard this wonderful dialogue between \\nLord Krishna and Arjuna, causing my hair to stand on end. (18.74) \\nBy the grace of guru sage Vyasa, I heard this most secret and supreme yoga directly from Krishna, the Lord of yoga, Himself speaking to Arjuna before my very eyes of clairvoyance granted by sage \\nVyasa. (18.75) O King, by repeated remembrance of this marvelous and sacred dialogue between Lord Krishna and Arjuna, I am \\nthrilled at every moment, and (18.76) recollecting again and again, \\nO King, that marvelous form of Krishna I am greatly amazed, and \\nI rejoice over and over again. (18.77) \\nBoth spiritual knowledge and action are needed\\nWherever there will be both Krishna, the Lord of yoga (or \\nDharma in the form of the scriptures) and Arjuna with the weapons \\nof duty and protection, there will be everlasting prosperity, victory, \\nhappiness, and morality. This is my conviction. (18.78)\\nThus ends the Bhagavad-Gita\\nThis book is offered to the Lord of the Universe\\nMay He bless us all with Goodness.'"

       "[Document(page_content='\\nBHAGAVAD-GITA in ENGLISH\\nAuthor: Sage Veda Vyasa\\nTranslated in English: Ramananda Prasad, Ph.D.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nThe Bhagavad-Gita is a doctrine of universal truth and a book \\nof moral and spiritual growth. Its message is sublime and non-sectarian. It deals with the most sacred metaphysical science. It imparts the knowledge of the Self and answers two universal questions: Who am I, and how can I lead a happy and peaceful life in \\nthis word full of dualities and dilemmas?\\nIt\\'s a timeless book of wisdom that inspired Thoreau, Emerson, \\nEinstein, Oppenheimer, Gandhi and many others. The BhagavadGita teaches us how to equip ourselves for the battle of life. A repeated study with faith purifies our psyche and guides us to face \\nthe challenges of modern living leading to inner peace and happiness.\\nGita teaches the spiritual science of Self-realization (SR) based \\non the essence of Upanishads and Vedanta. The prime message \\nof the Gita is: The ultimate purpose of life is to realize one’s essential nature and become one with the Supreme Self within all of us. \\nIt assures spiritual progress for all humans, and how to be one with \\nthe Supreme. Its teachings are profound, universal, uplifting, and \\nsublime. \\nThe ignorance of metaphysical or Spiritual knowledge—not \\nknowing our real identity—is humanity’s greatest predicament. It is \\nsaid that there is no human mind that cannot be purified by a repeated study of the Gita. Gita explains the basic principles of spiritual science— using Sanskrit poetry— in a very clear and inspiring \\nmanner. Sacred relationship between the Creator and the creation\\nis well established in the Gita. If one lives in the spirit of even a few \\nverses of the Gita, one’s life will be transformed into divinity. \\nThe philosophy of duty, devotion and Self-knowledge is wonderfully synthesized and harmonized in the Gita—without creating \\nany conflict among them—to give the reader eternal bliss, everlasting peace and perennial joy in life. It awakens Cosmic Consciousness and stimulates life with spirituality. Religion tends to create a \\nwall of division and conflicts along religious lines. Whereas, spirituality unites people by breaking those walls. A spiritual person is a \\nfriend of all and a foe of none, because he considers all creatures—living or non-living—as part and parcel of the Cosmic body \\nof the Absolute, the Source.\\nThe message of the Gita came to humanity due to Arjuna’s \\nunwillingness to do his duty as a warrior, because fighting involved \\ndestruction and killing. Nonviolence or Ahinsa is one of the most \\nfundamental tenets of spiritual culture. All lives, human or non-human, are sacred. This immortal discourse between the Supreme \\nLord, Krishna, and His devotee-friend, Arjuna, occurs not in a temple, a secluded forest, or on a mountain top; but on a battlefield on \\nthe eve of a big war. Anyone can be helped by practice of only a few of \\nits teachings. No change of one’s faith or life-style is needed!\\nA total of seven hundred (700) verses of the Gita, in 18 chapters, are recorded in world’s longest epic, Mahabharata, having \\nover 100,000 verses in Sanskrit poetry. In Gita Lord Krishna advises Arjuna to get up and fight. This may create a misunderstanding of the principles of non-violence if the background of the war of \\nMahabharata is not kept in mind. Therefore, a brief historical description is in order.\\nIn ancient times there was a king who had two sons, Dhritarashtra and Pandu. The former was born blind; therefore, Pandu \\ninherited the kingdom. Pandu had five sons. They were called the \\nPandavas. Dhritarashtra had one hundred sons. They were called \\nthe Kauravas. Duryodhana was the eldest of the Kauravas. \\nAfter the death of king Pandu, the eldest son of Pandu became \\nthe lawful King. Duryodhana was a very jealous person. He also \\nwanted the kingdom. The kingdom was divided into two halves between the Pandavas and the Kauravas. Duryodhana was not satisfied with his share of the kingdom. He wanted the entire kingdom \\nfor himself. He unsuccessfully planned several foul plays to kill the \\nPandavas and take away their kingdom also. He unlawfully took \\npossession of the entire kingdom of the Pandavas and refused to \\ngive back even an acre of land without a war. All mediation by Lord \\nKrishna and others failed. The big war of Mahabharata was thus \\ninevitable. The Pandavas were unwilling participants. They had \\n\\n\\nonly two choices: Fight for their right as a matter of duty or run \\naway from war and accept defeat for the sake of peace and nonviolence. Arjuna, one of the five Pandava brothers, faced this dilemma in the battlefield: \\n\\nWhether to fight or run away from war for \\npeace.\\nArjuna’s dilemma is, in reality, the Universal Dilemma. All human beings face dilemmas, big or small, in their everyday life while\\nperforming their duties. Arjuna’s dilemma was a big one. He had to \\nmake a choice between fighting the war and killing his \\n\\nmost \\nrevered guru who was on the other side, very dear friends, close \\nrelatives, and many innocent warriors; or running away from the \\n\\nbattlefield for the sake of preserving peace and nonviolence. The \\nentire seven hundred verses of the Bhagavad-Gita are a discourse \\nbetween Lord Krishna and the confused Arjuna on the battlefield \\nnear New Delhi, India, in 3,139 BCE. This discourse was narrated\\nto the blind king, Dhritarashtra, by his charioteer, Sanjaya, as an \\neyewitness war report.\\nThe word ‘Bhagavad’ means the Supreme Being, God or Bhagavan in Sanskrit. ‘Gita’ means song. Thus, Bhagavad-Gita means \\nthe Song of God or The Celestial Song, because it was sung by \\nBhagavan Lord Krishna, an incarnation of God Himself. \\nCHAPTER 1\\n1. Arjuna’s Dilemma\\nThe blind King inquired from his charioteer: O Sanjaya, tell me \\nin detail, what did my sons and the Pandavas do in the battlefield \\nbefore the war started? (1.01)\\nChapter Summary\\nSanjaya said: Arjuna asked his charioteer-friend, Lord Krishna, \\nto drive his chariot between the two armies so that he could see \\nthe armies on both sides. Arjuna felt great compassion to see his \\nfriends and relatives on the opposite side, whom he must kill to win \\nthis war. He became confused, spoke of the evils of war, and refused to fight or do his duty as a warrior. \\nArjuna sat down on the back seat of the chariot with his mind \\noverwhelmed with sorrow. (Verse 1.47)\\nNOTE: Some non-essential verses from Chapters 1 and 2 only \\nhave been omitted for ease of understanding the teachings of the \\nGita by the first time readers.\\nCHAPTER 2\\n2. Spiritual knowledge\\nSanjaya said: Lord Krishna spoke these words to Arjuna whose \\neyes were tearful and downcast, and who was overwhelmed with \\ncompassion and despair. (2.01) O King, Lord Krishna, as if smiling, \\nspoke these words to distressed Arjuna in the midst of the two armies. (2.10) \\nTeachings of the Gita begins \\nImportant verses are highlighted. First time readers should \\nread and understand these verses first.\\nThe Supreme Lord said: You grieve for those who are not worthy of grief; and yet speak words of wisdom. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead. (2.11) There was never a time \\nwhen these monarchs, you, or I did not exist, nor shall we ever \\ncease to exist in the future. (2.12) Just as a living being acquires a \\nchildhood body, a youth body, and an old-age body during this life; \\nsimilarly, it acquires another new body after death. The wise are \\nnot deluded by this. (2.13) The contacts of the senses with the \\nsense objects give rise to the feelings of heat and cold, pain and \\npleasure. They are transitory and impermanent. Therefore, learn \\nto endure them, O Arjuna, (2.14) because a calm person — who is \\nnot afflicted by these sense objects, and is steady in pain and \\npleasure — becomes fit for immortality, O Arjuna. (2.15) \\nThe spirit is eternal, body is transitory\\nThe invisible Spirit is eternal, and the visible world, including \\nthe physical body, is transitory. The reality of these two is indeed \\ncertainly seen by the seers of Truth. (2.16) The Spirit by which all \\nthis universe is pervaded is indestructible. No one can destroy the \\nimperishable Spirit. (2.17) Bodies of the eternal, immutable, and \\nincomprehensible Spirit are perishable. Therefore, fight, O Arjuna. \\n(2.18) One who thinks that Spirit is a slayer, and one who thinks \\nSpirit is slain, are both ignorant. Because Spirit neither slays nor is \\nslain. (2.19) The Spirit is neither born nor does it die at any time. It \\ndoes not come into being, or cease to exist. It is unborn, eternal, \\npermanent, and primeval. The Spirit is not destroyed when the \\nbody is destroyed. (2.20) O Arjuna, how can a person who knows \\nthat the Spirit is indestructible, eternal, unborn, and immutable, kill \\nanyone or cause anyone to be killed? (2.21)\\nDeath and Reincarnation of the soul\\nJust as a person puts on new garments after discarding the old \\nones; similarly, the living entity acquires new bodies after casting \\naway the old bodies. (2.22) Weapons do not cut this Spirit, fire \\ndoes not burn it, water does not make it wet, and the wind does not \\nmake it dry. Spirit cannot be cut, burned, wet, or dried. It is eternal, \\n\\n\\nall-pervading, unchanging, immovable, and primeval. (2.23-24) \\nThe Spirit is said to be unexplainable, incomprehensible, and unchanging. Knowing this Spirit as such, you should not grieve. (2.25)\\nEven if you think that this living being takes birth and dies perpetually, even then, O Arjuna, you should not grieve like this. Because, death is certain for one who is born, and birth is certain for \\none who dies; and the cycle of birth-death continues. Therefore, \\nyou should not lament over the inevitable. (2.26-27) All beings, O \\nArjuna, are unmanifest — invisible to our physical eyes — before \\nbirth and after death. They manifest between the birth and the \\ndeath only. What is there to grieve about? (2.28) Some look upon \\n\\nthis Spirit as a wonder, another describes it as wonderful, and others hear of it as a wonder. Even after hearing about it very few \\npeople know it. (2.29) O Arjuna, the Spirit that dwells in the body \\nof all beings is eternally indestructible. Therefore, you should not \\nmourn for anybody. (2.30) \\nDuty of a warrior\\nConsidering also your duty as a warrior, you should not waver. \\nBecause there is nothing more auspicious for a warrior than a righteous war. (2.31) Only the fortunate warriors, O Arjuna, get such an \\nopportunity for a righteous war against evil that is like an open door \\nto heaven. (2.32)\\nCommentary\\nThe righteous war is not a religious war against the \\nfollowers of other religions. The righteous war may be waged \\neven against our own evil-doer kith and kin (RigVeda\\n6.75.19). Life is a continuous battle between the forces of evil \\nand goodness. “Whosoever kills an innocent human being, it shall \\nbe regarded as if he has killed the entire humanity.” (Surah 5.32). \\nIt is better to die for a right cause and acquire the grace of \\nsacrifice than to die an ordinary but compulsory death. The gates \\nof heaven open wide for those who stand up to vindicate justice \\nand righteousness (Dharma). Not to oppose an evil is to indirectly \\nsupport it. Very similar ideas are expressed in other scriptures of \\nthe world. The Bible says: Happy are those who suffer persecution \\nbecause they do what God requires. The kingdom of heaven \\nbelongs to them (MATTHEW 5.10). There is no sin in killing an \\naggressor. Whosoever helps and supports an aggressor is also an \\naggressor. Thus, all those who supported Kauravas were basically \\naggressors and deserved to be eliminated.\\nIf you will not fight this righteous war, then you will fail in your \\nduty, lose your reputation, and incur sin. (2.33) People will talk \\nabout your disgrace forever. To the honored, dishonor is worse \\nthan death. (2.34) The great warriors will think that you have retreated from the battle out of fear. Those who have greatly esteemed you will lose respect for you. (2.35) Your enemies will \\nspeak many unmentionable words and scorn your ability. What \\ncould be more painful to you than this? (2.36) You will go to heaven \\nif killed in the line of duty, or you will enjoy the kingdom on the earth \\nif victorious. Therefore, get up with a determination to fight, O Arjuna. (2.37) Treating pleasure and pain, gain and loss, and victory \\nand defeat alike, engage yourself in your duty. By doing your duty \\nthis way, you will not incur sin. (2.38) \\nImportance of Karma-yoga, the selfless action\\nThe wisdom of spiritual knowledge has been imparted to you, \\nO Arjuna. Now listen to the wisdom of Karma-yoga, the selfless \\nservice (Seva), endowed with which you will free yourself from the \\nbondage or reactions of action (Karma). (2.39) In Karma-yoga, no \\neffort is ever lost and there is no adverse effect. Even a little practice of this discipline protects one from the great fear of birth and \\ndeath. (2.40) A Karma-yogi has a resolute determination for Godrealization, O Arjuna, but the desires of one who works to enjoy the \\nfruits of work are endless. (2.41) \\nMaterial and spiritual aspects of life\\nThe misguided ones who delight in the melodious chanting of \\nthe Vedas or any scripture — without understanding its real purpose — think, O Arjuna, as if there is nothing else in it except the \\nrituals for the sole purpose of obtaining heavenly enjoyment. (2.42) \\nThey are dominated by material desires and consider the attainment of heaven as the highest goal of life. They engage in specific \\nrites for the sake of prosperity and enjoyment. Rebirth is the result \\nof their action. (2.43) The resolute determination of Self-realization \\nis not formed in the minds of those who are attached to pleasure \\nand power and whose judgment is obscured by such ritualistic activities. (2.44) A portion of the Vedas deals with three modes or \\nstates of the material Nature. Become free from pairs of opposites; \\nbe ever balanced and unconcerned with the thoughts of acquisition \\nand preservation. Rise above the three states, and be Self-conscious, O Arjuna. (2.45) To a Self-realized person, scriptures are \\nas useful as a small reservoir of water when the water of a huge \\nlake becomes available. (2.46) \\nTheory and practice of Karma-yoga\\nYou have control over your respective duty only, but no control \\nor claim over the results. The fruits of work should not be your only \\nmotive and you should never be inactive. (2.47) Do your duty to \\nthe best of your ability, O Arjuna, with your mind attached to the \\nLord, abandoning worry and attachment to the results, and remaining calm in both success and failure. The calmness of mind is \\ncalled Karma-yoga. (2.48) Work done with selfish motives is inferior by far to selfless service or Karma-yoga. Therefore, be a \\nKarma-yogi, O Arjuna. Those who work only to enjoy the fruits of \\ntheir labor are, in truth, unhappy. Because, one has no control over \\n\\n\\nthe results. (2.49) \\nA true Karma-yogi becomes free from both vice and virtue in \\nthis very life. Therefore, strive for Karma-yoga. Working to the best \\nof one’s abilities without becoming attached to the fruits of work is \\ncalled Karma-yoga. (2.50) Wise Karma-yogis are freed from the \\nbondage of rebirth by renouncing attachment to the fruits of all \\nwork and attain a blissful divine state. (2.51) When your intellect \\ncompletely pierces the veil of confusion, then you will become indifferent to what has been heard and what is to be heard from the \\nscriptures. (2.52) \\n\\nWhen your intellect, that is confused by the conflicting opinions \\nand the ritualistic doctrine of the Vedas, shall stay steady and firm \\non concentrating on the Supreme Being, then you shall attain union \\nwith the Supreme Being in trance. (2.53) Arjuna said: O Krishna, \\nwhat are the marks of an enlightened person whose intellect is\\nsteady? How does a person of steady intellect speak? How does \\nsuch a person sit and walk? (2.54) \\nMarks of a Self-realized person\\nThe Supreme Lord said: When one is completely free from all \\ndesires of the mind and is satisfied with the Eternal Being (God) by \\nthe joy of Eternal Being, then one is called an enlightened person, \\nO Arjuna. (2.55) A person whose mind is unperturbed by sorrow, \\nwho does not crave pleasures — and who is completely free from \\nattachment, fear, and anger— is called a sage of steady mind. \\n(2.56) Those who are not attached to anything, who are neither \\nelated by getting desired results, nor troubled by undesired results, \\ntheir intellect is considered steady. (2.57) When one can completely withdraw the senses from its sense objects— as a tortoise \\nwithdraws its limbs into the shell for protection from dangers— then \\nthe intellect of such a person is considered steady. (2.58) The desire for sensual pleasures fades away if one abstains from sense \\nenjoyment, but the craving for sense enjoyment remains. The craving also disappears from one who has known the Supreme Being. \\n(2.59) \\nDangers of unrestrained senses\\nRestless senses, O Arjuna, forcibly carry away the mind of \\neven a wise person striving for perfection. (2.60) One should fix \\none’s mind on Me with loving contemplation after bringing the \\nsenses under control. One’s intellect becomes steady when one’s \\nsenses are under complete control. (2.61) One develops attachment to sense objects by thinking about sense objects. Desire for \\nsense objects comes from attachment to sense objects, and anger \\ncomes from unfulfilled desires. (2.62) Delusion or wild ideas arise \\nfrom anger. The mind is bewildered by delusion. Reasoning is destroyed when the mind is bewildered. One falls from the right path \\nwhen reasoning is destroyed. (2.63)\\nPeace through sense control and Self-knowledge\\nA disciplined person, enjoying sense objects with senses that \\nare under control and free from likes and dislikes, attains tranquility. (2.64) All sorrows are destroyed upon attainment of tranquility. \\nThe intellect of such a tranquil person soon becomes completely \\nsteady and united with the Source. (2.65) There is neither Selfknowledge nor Self-perception to those who are not united with the \\nEternal Being. Without Self-perception there is no peace, and without peace there can be no happiness. (2.66) \\nThe mind, when controlled by roving senses, steals away the \\nintellect as a storm takes away a boat on the sea from its destination — the spiritual shore. (2.67) Therefore, O Arjuna, one’s intellect becomes steady when the senses are completely withdrawn \\nfrom its sense objects. (2.68) A yogi, the person of self-restraint, \\nremains wakeful when it is night for all others. It is night for a yogi \\nwho sees when all others are wakeful. (2.69)\\nNOTE: What is considered real by a yogi is of no value for \\na worldly person and vice-versa.\\nOne attains peace when all desires dissipate within the mind \\nwithout creating any mental disturbance, just as river waters enter \\nthe full ocean without creating any disturbance. One who desires \\nmaterial objects is never peaceful. (2.70) One who abandons all \\ndesires, and becomes free from longing and the feeling of “i” and \\n“my”, attains peace. (2.71) O Arjuna, this is the superconscious \\nstate of mind. Attaining this state, one is no longer deluded. Gaining this state, even at the end of one’s life, a person attains Nirvana \\n(or becomes one with the Absolute). (2.72)\\nCHAPTER 3\\n3. Path of Selfless service, Karma-yoga\\nArjuna said: If You consider acquiring spiritual knowledge is \\nbetter than working, then why do You want me to engage in this \\nhorrible war, O Krishna? You seem to confuse my mind by apparently conflicting words. Tell me, decisively, one thing by which I \\nmay attain the Supreme. (3.01-02) The Supreme Lord said: In this \\nworld, O Arjuna, a twofold path of spiritual discipline has been \\nstated by Me in the past — the path of Self-knowledge for the contemplative, introverts and the path of unselfish work (Seva, Karmayoga) for all others. (3.03) One does not attain freedom from the \\nbondage of Karma by merely abstaining from work. No one attains \\nperfection by merely giving up work. (3.04) Because no one can \\nremain actionless even for a moment, everyone is driven to action \\n— helplessly indeed — by the forces of nature. (3.05) The deluded \\nones, who restrain their organs of action but mentally dwell upon \\n\\n\\nthe sense enjoyment, are called hypocrites. (3.06) \\nWhy one should serve others?\\nOne who controls the senses by a trained and purified mind \\nand intellect, and engages the organs of action to selfless service, \\nis superior, O Arjuna. (3.07) Perform your obligatory duty because \\nworking is indeed better than sitting idle. Even the maintenance of \\nyour body would be impossible without work. (3.08) Human beings \\nare bound by work that is not performed as a selfless service. \\nTherefore, O Arjuna, becoming free from attachment to the fruits \\nof work, do your duty efficiently as a service to Me. (3.09) \\n\\nThe first commandment of the creator\\nBrahma, the creator, in the beginning created human beings \\ntogether with selfless service (Seva, sacrifice) and said: By Seva\\nor sacrifice of self-interest you shall prosper, and Seva shall fulfill \\nall your desires. (3.10) Help the celestial controllers (Devas) with selfless service and they will help you. Thus helping each other, you shall \\nattain the Supreme goal of human life. (3.11) The celestial controllers, pleased by selfless service, will give you desired objects even \\nwithout asking for it. One who enjoys the gift of celestials without \\noffering them anything in return is, indeed, a thief. (3.12) The righteous who eat the remnants of selfless service are freed from all \\nsins, but the impious who cook food only for themselves (without \\nfirst offering to Me, or sharing with others), in truth, eat sin (3.13). \\nThe physical body of living beings is made up of and sustained by \\nfood; food is created by God from five basic elements. God is \\npleased by the sacrifice (Qurbani) of self-interest: The selfless philanthropic work, and blesses selfless persons. Selfless work or sacrifice is our duty. Duty is prescribed in the scriptures. The scriptures\\ncome from God. Thus, the all-pervading God is ever present in \\nselfless service, Seva. (3.14-15) One who does not help to keep \\nthe wheel of creation in motion by sacrificial duty and who rejoices \\nsense pleasures only, that sinful person lives in vain, O Arjuna. \\n(3.16) For a Self-realized person, who rejoices only with God, who \\nis delighted with God and who is content with God, there is no duty. \\n(3.17) Such a person has no interest, whatsoever, in what is done \\nor what is not done. A Self-realized person does not depend on \\nanybody, except God, for anything. (3.18) \\nLeaders should set an example\\nTherefore, always perform your duty efficiently and without any \\nattachment to the results, because by doing work without attachment one attains the Supreme Being. (3.19) King Janaka and others attained perfection (or Self-realization) by selfless service \\n(Karma-yoga) alone. You should also perform your duty with a view \\nto guide people, and for universal welfare of the society. (3.20) \\nWhatever noble persons do, others follow. Whatever standard they \\nset up, the world follows. (3.21) O Arjuna, there is nothing in the \\nthree worlds (heaven, earth, and the lower regions) that should be \\ndone by Me, nor there is anything that I should obtain, yet I engage \\nin action. (3.22) If I do not engage in action relentlessly, O Arjuna, \\npeople would follow My path. These worlds would perish if I do not \\nwork, and I would be the cause of confusion and destruction of all \\nthese people. (3.23-24) As the ignorant work, O Arjuna, with attachment to the fruits of work, so the wise should work without attachment, for the welfare of the society. (3.25) The wise should not \\nunsettle the minds of the ignorant, who are attached to the fruits of \\nwork, but should inspire others by performing all works, efficiently,\\nwithout attachment to results. (3.26) \\nAll works are the works of Nature\\nAll work is done by the energy and power of nature, but due to \\ndelusion of ignorance, people assume themselves to be the doer\\nand thus incur sin or Karmic bondage. (3.27) One who knows the \\ntruth, O Arjuna, about the role of the forces of nature and work, \\ndoes not become attached to work, knowing very well that it’s the \\nforces of nature that work with their instruments — our organs. \\n(3.28) Those who are deluded by the illusive power (Maya) of Nature become attached to the work done by the forces of nature. \\nThe wise should not disturb the mind of the ignorant whose \\nknowledge is imperfect. (3.29) Do your duty — dedicating all work \\nto Me — in a spiritual frame of mind, free from desire, attachment, \\nand mental grief. (3.30) Those who always practice this teaching \\nof Mine — with faith, sincerity and free from complain — are freed \\nfrom the bondage of Karma. But those who carp at My teaching \\nand do not practice it, should be considered ignorant of all \\nknowledge, senseless, and lost. (3.31-32) All beings follow their \\nnature. Even the wise act according to their own nature. What, \\nthen, is the value of sense restraint? (3.33)\\nTwo stumbling blocks on the path \\nLikes and dislikes for sense objects remain in the senses. One \\nshould not come under the control of these two, because they are, \\nindeed, two major stumbling blocks on one’s path of Self-realization. (3.34) One’s inferior natural work is better than superior unnatural work. Death in carrying out one’s natural work is useful. \\nUnnatural work produces too much stress. (3.35) \\nLust is the origin of sin\\nArjuna said: O Krishna, what impels one to commit sin as if \\nunwillingly and forced against one’s will? (3.36) The Supreme Lord \\nsaid: It is lust (or intense desire for material and sensual pleasures), born out of passion, that becomes anger when unfulfilled. \\nLust is insatiable and is a great devil. Know this as the enemy. \\n(3.37) As the fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror by dust, and as \\n\\n\\nan embryo by the amnion, similarly Self-knowledge becomes obscured by lust. (3.38) O Arjuna, Self-knowledge becomes covered \\nby this insatiable fire of lust, the eternal enemy of the wise. (3.39) \\nThe senses, the mind, and the intellect are said to be the seat of \\nlust. Lust — by controlling the senses, the mind, and the intellect \\n— deludes a person by veiling Self-knowledge. (3.40) Therefore, \\nO Arjuna, by controlling the senses first, kill this devil of material \\ndesire that destroys Self-knowledge and Self-realization. (3.41) \\nHow to control lust\\nThe senses are said to be superior to the body; the mind is \\nsuperior to the senses; the intellect is superior to the mind; and \\n\\nSpirit is superior to the intellect. (3.42) Thus, knowing the Spirit to \\nbe superior to the intellect, and controlling the mind by the intellect \\nthat is purified by spiritual practices, one must kill this mighty enemy, lust, O Arjuna. (3.43)\\nCHAPTER 4\\n4. Path of renunciation with Self-knowledge\\nKarma-yoga is an ancient law \\nThe Supreme Lord said: I taught this Karma-yoga, the eternal \\nscience of selfless action, to King Vivasvan. Vivasvan taught it to \\nManu. Manu taught it to Ikshvaku. Thus handed down in succession the saintly Kings knew this. After a long time the science of \\nKarma-yoga was lost from this earth. Today I have described the \\nsame ancient science to you because you are my sincere devotee \\nand friend. Karma-yoga is the supreme secret indeed. (4.01-03) \\nArjuna said: You were born later, but Vivasvan was born in ancient \\ntime. How am I to understand that You taught this Karma-yoga in \\nthe beginning of the creation? (4.04)\\nThe purpose of incarnation of God\\nThe Supreme Lord said: Both you and I have taken many \\nbirths. I remember them all, O Arjuna, but you do not remember. \\n(4.05) Though I am eternal, immutable, and the Lord of all beings, \\nyet I manifest myself by controlling My own material Nature, using \\nMy divine potential energy (Maya). (4.06) Whenever there is a decline of Dharma (Righteousness) and a predominance of Adharma \\n(or Unrighteousness), O Arjuna, then I manifest Myself. I appear \\nfrom time to time for protecting the good, for transforming the \\nwicked, and for establishing world order (Dharma). (4.07-08) The \\none who truly understands My transcendental appearance and activities of creation, maintenance, and dissolution, attains My supreme abode and is not born again after leaving this body, O Arjuna. (4.09) Many have become free from attachment, fear, anger, \\nand attained salvation by taking refuge in Me, becoming fully absorbed in My thoughts, and becoming purified by the fire of Selfknowledge. (4.10) \\nPath of worship and prayer\\nWith whatever motive people worship Me, I fulfill their desires \\naccordingly. People worship Me with different motives. (4.11) \\nThose who long for success in their work here on the earth worship \\nthe celestial controllers. Success in work comes quickly in this human world. (4.12) The four divisions — based on aptitude and vocation — of human society were created by Me. Though I am the \\nauthor of this system of the division of labor, one should know that \\nI do nothing and I am eternal. (4.13) Work or Karma does not bind \\nMe, because I have no desire for the fruits of work. The one who \\nfully understands and practices this truth is also not bound by \\nKarma. (4.14) The ancient seekers of liberation also performed \\ntheir duties with this understanding. Therefore, you should do your \\nduty as the ancients did. (4.15)\\nAttached, detached, and forbidden action\\nEven the wise ones are confused about what is action and what \\nis inaction. Therefore, I shall clearly explain what is action, knowing \\nthat one shall be liberated from the evil of birth and death. (4.16) \\nThe true nature of action is very difficult to understand. Therefore, \\none should know the nature of attached or selfish action, the nature \\nof detached or selfless action, and also the nature of forbidden action. (4.17) \\nA Karma-yogi is not subject to the Karmic laws\\nThe one who sees inaction in action, and action in inaction, is \\na wise person. Such a person is a yogi and has accomplished everything. (4.18) \\nTo see inaction in action and vice versa is to understand that \\nthe Lord does all the work indirectly through His power by using us. \\nHe is the inactive actor. We are actively inactive, because we cannot do anything without the flow of His power. Therefore, we are \\nnot the doer, just an instrument in His hands.\\nA person, whose desires have become selfless by being \\nroasted in the fire of Self-knowledge, is called a sage by the wise. \\n(4.19) The one who has abandoned attachment to the fruits of \\nwork, and remains ever content and dependent on no one but God, \\nsuch a person — though engaged in activity — does nothing at all \\nand incurs no Karmic reaction, good or bad. (4.20) The one who is \\nfree from desires, whose mind and senses are under control, and \\nwho has renounced all proprietorship, does not incur sin — the \\nKarmic reaction — by doing bodily action. (4.21) Content with \\n\\n\\nwhatever gain comes naturally by His will, unaffected by pairs of \\nopposites, free from envy, calm in success and failure, though engaged in work, such a Karma-yogi is not bound by Karma. (4.22) \\nThe one who is free from attachment, whose mind is fixed in Selfknowledge, who does work as a service (Seva) to the Lord, all Karmic bonds of such a philanthropic person (Karma-yogi) dissolve \\naway. (4.23) God shall be realized by the one who considers everything as a manifestation or an act of God. (Also see 9.16) (4.24) \\nDifferent types of spiritual practices \\nSome yogis perform the service of worship to celestial controllers (Devas, guardian angels), while others study scriptures for \\nSelf-knowledge. Some restrain their senses and give up their sensual pleasures. Others perform breathing and other yogic exercises. Some give charity and offer their wealth as a sacrifice. (4.25-\\n\\n28) Those who are engaged in yogic practices, reach the breathless state of trance (Samadhi) by offering inhalation into exhalation \\nand exhalation into inhalation as a sacrifice using yogic techniques. \\n(4.29) Others restrict their diet and offer their inhalations as sacrifice into their inhalations. All these people are the knowers of sacrifice, and are purified by their sacrifice. (4.30) Those who perform \\nselfless service obtain the nectar of Self-knowledge as a result of \\ntheir sacrifice and attain the Eternal Being. O Arjuna, even this \\nworld is not a happy place for the non-sacrificer, how can the other \\nworld be? (4.31) Many types of spiritual disciplines are described \\nin the Vedas. Know them all to be born from Karma or the action \\nof body, mind, and senses. Knowing this, you shall attain Nirvana. \\n(4.32) \\nA superior spiritual practice\\nThe acquisition and propagation of Self-knowledge are superior to any material gain or gift, O Arjuna. Because all actions in \\ntheir entirety culminate in knowledge. (4.33) Acquire this spiritual\\nknowledge from a Self-realized guru by humble reverence, by sincere inquiry, and by service. The wise ones who have realized the \\nTruth will teach you. (4.34) After knowing the Truth, O Arjuna, you \\nshall not again become deluded like this. By this knowledge you \\nshall behold the entire creation first within Me, the Supreme Being, \\nthen within your own higher self and then see Me alone in everything. (4.35) Even if one is the most sinful of all sinners, one shall \\nyet cross over the ocean of sin by the raft of Self-knowledge. (4.36) \\nAs the blazing fire reduces wood to ashes; similarly, the fire of Selfknowledge reduces all bonds of Karma (or sin) to ashes, O Arjuna. \\n(4.37)\\nSpiritual knowledge is revealed to a Karma-yogi\\nIn truth, there is no purifier in this world like the true knowledge \\nof the Supreme Being. One who becomes purified by Karma-yoga\\ndiscovers this knowledge within, naturally, in due course of time. \\n(4.38) The one who has faith and is sincere in yogic practices and \\nhas control over the senses, gains this spiritual knowledge. Having \\ngained this knowledge, one at once attains supreme peace. (4.39) \\nThe irrational, the faithless, and the atheist perish. There is neither \\nthis world, nor the world beyond, nor happiness for the disbeliever. \\n(4.40)\\nKnowledge, Karma-yoga are needed for Nirvana\\nWork (Karma) does not bind a person who has renounced work \\nby renouncing attachment to the fruits of work, and whose doubts \\nabout the Self are completely destroyed by Self-knowledge, O Arjuna. (4.41) Therefore, cut the ignorance-born doubt about the Supreme Being abiding in your mind by the sword of Self-knowledge, \\nresort to Karma-yoga, and get up for the war, O Arjuna. (4.42) \\nCHAPTER 5\\n5. Path of renunciation\\nArjuna said: O Krishna, You praise spiritual knowledge and \\nalso performance of selfless service. Tell me, definitely, which one \\nis the better of the two. (5.01) The Supreme Lord said: The path of \\nSelf-knowledge and the path of selfless service both lead to the \\nsupreme goal. But, of the two, selfless service is superior to Selfknowledge. (5.02) A person should be considered a true Samnyasi \\n(renunciant) who neither likes nor dislikes. One is easily liberated \\nfrom Karmic bondage by becoming free from the pairs of opposites, O Arjuna. (5.03) \\nBoth paths lead to the Supreme\\nThe ignorant — not the wise — consider the path of Selfknowledge (or renunciation) and the path of selfless service \\n(Karma-yoga) as different from each other. The person who has \\ntruly mastered one, gets the benefits of both. (5.04) Whatever goal \\na Samnyasi reaches, a Karma-yogi also reaches the same goal. \\nTherefore, the one who sees the path of renunciation and the path \\nof unselfish work as the same, really sees. (5.05) But, true renunciation, O Arjuna, is difficult to attain without Karma-yoga. A sage \\nequipped with Karma-yoga quickly attains God. (5.06) A Karmayogi whose mind is pure, whose mind and senses are under control, and who sees one and the same Eternal Being in all beings, \\nis not bound by Karma though intensely engaged in work. (5.07) \\nA Karma-yogi works for God only\\nThe wise (or Samnyasi) who knows the truth thinks: \"I do nothing at all\". In seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, walking, \\nsleeping, breathing; and speaking, giving, taking, as well as opening and closing the eyes, a Samnyasi believes that only the senses \\nare operating upon their objects. (5.08-09) One who does all work \\nas an offering to the Lord — abandoning attachment to the results \\n— remains untouched by Karmic reaction or sin as a lotus leaf \\nnever gets wet by water, while living in it. (5.10) The Karma-yogis \\nperform action —without attachment — with their body, mind, intellect, and senses only for self-purification. (5.11) A Karma-yogi\\n\\n\\nattains Supreme Bliss by abandoning attachment to the fruits of \\nwork; while others, who are attached to the fruits of work, become \\nbound by selfish work. (5.12)\\nThe path of Self-knowledge\\nA person who has completely renounced attachment to the \\nfruits of all works, lives happily, neither performing nor directing any \\naction. (5.13) The Lord neither creates the urge for action, nor the \\nfeeling of doership, nor the attachment to the results of action in \\npeople. All these are done by the powers of Nature. (5.14) The \\nLord does not take the responsibility for the good or evil deeds of \\n\\nanybody. The Self-knowledge becomes covered by the veil of ignorance; thereby people become deluded and do evil deeds. (5.15) \\nSpiritual knowledge destroys the ignorance of the Self and reveals \\nthe Supreme, just as the Sun reveals the beauty of objects of the \\nworld. (5.16) Persons whose mind and intellect are totally merged \\nwith the Source, who are firmly devoted to the Source, who have \\nthe Source as their supreme goal and sole refuge, and whose impurities are destroyed by the knowledge of the Source, do not take \\nbirth again. (5.17) \\nAdditional marks of an enlightened person\\nAn enlightened person — by perceiving the Lord in all — looks \\nat a learned and humble priest, an outcast, even a cow, an elephant, or a dog with an equal eye. (5.18) Everything has been accomplished in this very life by the one whose mind is set in equality. \\nSuch a person has realized God, because God is flawless and impartial. (5.19) One who neither rejoices on obtaining what is pleasant, nor grieves on obtaining the unpleasant, who has a steady \\nmind, who is undeluded, and who is a knower of the Supreme Being, such a person eternally abides with the Supreme Being. (5.20) \\nSuch a person who is in union with the Supreme Being becomes \\nunattached to sensual pleasures by discovering the joy of the Self \\nthrough contemplation, and enjoys spiritual bliss. (5.21) Sensual \\npleasures are, in truth, the source of misery, and have a beginning \\nand an end. Therefore, the wise do not rejoice sensual pleasures. \\n(5.22) One who is able to withstand the impulse of lust and anger \\nbefore death is a yogi, and a happy person. (5.23) One who finds \\nhappiness with the Eternal Being, who rejoices Eternal Being \\nwithin, and who is illuminated by Self-knowledge; such a yogi attains Nirvana, and goes to Eternal Being. (5.24) Seers whose sins \\n(or imperfections) are destroyed, whose doubts have been dispelled by Self-knowledge, whose minds are disciplined, and who \\nare engaged in the welfare of all beings, attain the Supreme Being. \\n(5.25) They, who are free from lust and anger, who have subdued \\nthe mind and senses, and who have known the Self, easily attain \\nNirvana. (5.26)\\nPath of meditation and contemplation\\nA sage is liberated by renouncing all material enjoyments, focusing the eyes and the mind between the eye-brows, equalizing \\nthe breath moving through the nostrils by using yogic techniques, \\nkeeping the senses, mind, and intellect under control, having salvation as the prime goal, and by becoming free from lust, anger, \\ngreed and fear. (5.27-28) My devotee attains peace by knowing \\nMe, the Supreme Being as the enjoyer of sacrifices and austerities, \\nas the great Lord of all the universe, and the friend of all beings. \\n(5.29) \\nCHAPTER 6\\n6. Path of meditation\\nA Karma-yogi is also a renunciant\\nThe Supreme Lord said: One who performs the prescribed duty \\nwithout seeking its fruit only for personal enjoyment, is a renunciant \\n(Samnyasi) and a Karma-yogi. One does not become Samnyasi \\nmerely by not lighting the fire, and one does not become a yogi \\nmerely by abstaining from work. (6.01) O Arjuna, what they call \\nrenunciation (Samnyasa) is also known as Karma-yoga. No one \\nbecomes a Karma-yogi who has not renounced the selfish motive \\nbehind an action. (6.02) \\nA definition of yoga and yogi\\nFor the wise who seeks to attain yoga of meditation or calmness of mind, Karma-yoga is said to be the means. For the one \\nwho has attained yoga, the calmness becomes the means of Selfrealization. A person is said to have attained yogic perfection when \\none has no desire for sensual pleasures or attachment to the fruits \\nof work, and has renounced all selfish motives behind any action. \\n(6.03-04)\\nMind is both a friend and an enemy\\nOne must elevate — and not degrade — oneself by one’s own \\nmind. The mind alone is one’s friend as well as one’s enemy. The \\nmind is the friend of those who have control over it, and the same \\nmind acts like an enemy for those who do not control it. (6.05-06)\\nOne who has control over the lower self — the mind and senses \\n— is tranquil in heat and cold, in pleasure and pain, and in honor \\nand dishonor, and remains ever steadfast with the supreme Self. \\n(6.07) A person is called yogi who has both Self-knowledge and\\nSelf-realization, who is calm, who has control over the mind and \\nsenses, and to whom a clod, a stone, and gold are the same. (6.08) \\nA person is considered superior who is impartial towards companions, friends, enemies, neutrals, arbiters, haters, relatives, saints, \\nand sinners. (6.09) \\nTechniques of meditation\\nA yogi, seated in solitude and alone, should constantly try to \\ncontemplate the Supreme Being after bringing the mind and \\n\\n\\nsenses under control, and becoming free from desires and proprietorship. (6.10) One should sit on his or her own firm seat that is \\nneither too high nor too low, covered with dry grass, a deerskin, \\nand a cloth, one over the other, in a clean spot. Sitting there in a \\ncomfortable position and concentrating the mind on God, controlling the thoughts and the activities of the senses, one should practice meditation for self-purification. (6.11-12) One should sit by \\nholding the waist, spine, chest, neck, and head erect, motionless \\nand steady; fix the eyes and the mind steadily in front of the nostrils, without looking around; make your mind serene and fearless; \\npractice celibacy; have the mind under control; think of Me; and \\n\\nhave Me as the supreme goal. (6.13-14) Thus, by always practicing to keep the mind fixed on Me, the yogi whose mind is subdued \\nattains peace of Nirvana and comes to Me. (6.15) \\nThis yoga is not possible, O Arjuna, for the one who eats too \\nmuch or who does not eat at all; who sleeps too much or who keeps \\nawake. (6.16) But for the one who is moderate in eating, recreation, \\nworking, sleeping, and waking, the yoga of meditation destroys all \\nsorrow. (6.17) A person is said to have achieved yoga, the union \\nwith the Eternal Being, when the perfectly disciplined mind becomes free from all desires and gets completely united with God in \\nSamadhi (trance). (6.18) A lamp in a spot sheltered by the Eternal \\nBeing from the wind of desires does not flicker; this simile is used \\nfor the subdued mind of a yogi, practicing meditation on the Eternal \\nBeing. (6.19) \\nWhen the mind, disciplined by the practice of meditation, becomes steady, one becomes content with the Eternal Being by beholding Him with purified intellect. (6.20) One feels infinite bliss that \\nis perceivable only through the intellect and is beyond the reach of \\nthe senses. After realizing the Eternal Being, one is never separated from the Absolute Reality. (6.21) After Self-realization (SR), \\none does not regard any other gain superior to SR. Established in \\nSR, one is not moved even by the greatest calamity. (6.22) The \\nstate of severance of union with sorrow is called yoga. This yoga \\nshould be practiced with firm determination and without any mental \\nreservation. (6.23) One gradually attains tranquility of mind by totally abandoning all selfish desires, completely restraining the \\nsenses from the sense objects by the intellect, keeping the mind \\nfully absorbed in the Eternal Being by means of a well-trained and \\npurified intellect, and thinking of Me. (6.24-25) Wheresoever this \\nrestless and unsteady mind wanders away during meditation, one \\nshould just witness it under the supervision of the Self. (6.26) \\nWho is a yogi?\\nSupreme bliss comes to a Self-realized yogi, whose mind is \\ntranquil, whose desires are under control, and who is free from sin \\n(or faults). (6.27) Such a sinless yogi, who constantly engages his \\nor her mind and intellect with the Eternal Being, easily enjoys the \\ninfinite bliss of contact with God. (6.28) Because of perceiving the \\nomnipresent Eternal Being abiding in all beings, and all beings \\nabiding in the Eternal Being; a yogi, who is in union with the Eternal \\nBeing, sees every being with an equal eye. (6.29) Those who perceive Me in everything and behold everything in Me, are not separated from Me, and I am not separated from them. (6.30) The nondualists, who adore Me as abiding in all beings, abide in Me irrespective of their mode of living. (6.31) One is considered the best \\nyogi who regards every being like oneself and who can feel the \\npain and pleasures of others as one’s own, O Arjuna. (6.32) \\nTwo methods to subdue the mind\\nArjuna said: O Krishna, You have said that the yoga of meditation is characterized by the calmness of mind, but due to restlessness of mind, I do not perceive the steady state of mind. Because \\nthe mind, indeed, is very unsteady, turbulent, powerful, and obstinate, O Krishna. I think restraining the mind is as difficult as restraining the wind. (6.33-34) The Supreme Lord said: Undoubtedly, \\nO Arjuna, the mind is restless and difficult to restrain, but it is subdued by constant vigorous spiritual practice with perseverance, \\nSelf-knowledge and detachment, O Arjuna. (6.35) In My opinion, \\nyoga is difficult for the one whose mind is not subdued. However, \\nyoga is attainable by the person of subdued mind by striving \\nthrough proper means. (6.36) \\nDestination of unsuccessful yogi\\nArjuna said: The faithful who deviates from the path of meditation and fails to attain yogic perfection due to unsubdued mind —\\nwhat is the destination of such a person, O Krishna? (6.37) Does \\nhe not perish like a dispersing cloud, O Krishna, having lost both \\nworldly and heavenly pleasures; supportless and bewildered on \\nthe path of Self-realization? (6.38) O Krishna, only You are able to \\ncompletely dispel this doubt of mine because there is none, other \\nthan You, who can dispel this doubt. (6.39) The Supreme Lord \\nsaid: There is no destruction, O Arjuna, for a yogi either here or \\nhereafter. A spiritualist is never put to grief, My dear friend. (6.40) \\nThe unsuccessful yogi is reborn in the house of the pious and \\nprosperous after attaining heaven and living there for many years, \\nor such a yogi is born in a family of enlightened yogis. A birth like \\nthis is very difficult, indeed, to obtain in this world. (6.41-42) There \\na yogi regains the knowledge acquired in the previous life and \\nstrives again to achieve perfection, O Arjuna. (6.43) The unsuccessful yogi is instinctively carried towards the Eternal Being by \\nvirtue of the impressions (Samskara) of yogic practices of previous \\nlives. Even the inquirer of yoga — the union with God — surpasses \\nthose who perform Vedic rituals. (6.44) The yogi who diligently \\n\\n\\nstrives, becomes completely free from all sins or imperfections after gradually perfecting through many incarnations, and reaches \\nthe Supreme Abode. (6.45) \\nWho is the best yogi?\\nThe yogi is superior to the ascetics. The yogi is superior to the \\nscholars. The yogi is superior to the ritualists. Therefore, O Arjuna, \\nbe a yogi. (6.46) I consider the yogi-devotee — who lovingly contemplates Me with supreme faith, and whose mind is ever absorbed in Me — to be the best of all the yogis. (6.47)\\nCHAPTER 7\\n7. Self-knowledge and enlightenment\\n\\nThe Supreme Lord said: O Arjuna, listen how you shall know \\nMe fully without any doubt, with your mind absorbed in Me, taking \\nrefuge in Me, and performing yogic practices. (7.01) I shall impart \\nyou Self-knowledge, together with enlightenment, after comprehending that nothing more remains to be known in this world. (7.02) \\nScarcely one out of thousands of persons strives for perfection of \\nSelf-realization. Scarcely one among those successful strivers \\ntruly understands Me. (7.03)\\nDefinitions of matter, consciousness, and spirit\\nThe mind, intellect, ego, ether, air, fire, water, and earth are the \\neightfold transformation (or division) of My material energy (Prakriti). (7.04) The material energy is My lower Nature. My other \\nhigher Nature is Spirit (Purusha) by which this entire universe is \\nsustained, O Arjuna. (7.05) Know that all creatures have evolved \\nfrom this twofold energy; and I, the Supreme Being, am the source \\nof origin, as well as dissolution of the entire universe. (7.06) \\nThe Supreme spirit is the basis of everything\\nThere is nothing higher than Me, O Arjuna. Everything in the \\nuniverse is strung on Me like jewels are strung on the thread of a \\nnecklace. (7.07) O Arjuna, I am the sapidity in the water, I am the \\nradiance in the sun and the moon, the sacred syllable ‘OM’ in all \\nthe Vedas, the sound in the ether, and potency in human beings. I \\nam the sweet fragrance in the earth. I am the heat in the fire, the \\nlife in all living beings, and the austerity in the ascetics. (7.08-09) \\nO Arjuna, know Me to be the eternal seed of all creatures. I am the \\nintelligence of the intelligent and the brilliance of the brilliant. I am \\nthe strength of the strong that is devoid of lust and attachment. I \\nam lust (Cupid) in human beings that is in accord with righteousness (Dharma) for the sacred and sole purpose of procreation after \\nmarriage, O Arjuna. (7.10-11) Know that three modes (Gunas) of \\nNature — goodness, passion, and ignorance — also emanate from \\nMe. I am not dependent on or affected by the Gunas, but the Gunas \\nare dependent on Me. (7.12) Human beings are deluded by the \\nvarious aspects of these three Gunas of Nature; therefore, they do \\nnot know Me, who is eternal and above these Gunas. (7.13) \\nWho seeks God?\\nThis divine power (Maya) of Mine, consisting of three modes \\n(Gunas) of Nature, is very difficult to overcome. Only those who \\nsurrender unto Me can easily cross over this Maya. (7.14) The evil \\ndoers, the ignorant, the lowest persons who are attached to demonic nature and whose power of discrimination has been taken \\naway by divine illusive power (Maya) do not worship or seek Me. \\n(7.15) \\nFour types of virtuous ones worship or seek Me, O Arjuna. They \\nare: The distressed, the seeker of Self-knowledge, the seeker of \\nwealth, and the enlightened one who has experienced the Supreme. (7.16) Among them the enlightened devotee, who is ever \\nunited with Me and whose devotion is single-minded, is the best, \\nbecause I am very dear to the enlightened, and the enlightened is \\nalso very dear to Me. (7.17) All these seekers are indeed noble, \\nbut I regard the enlightened devotee as My very Self. One who is \\nsteadfast becomes one with Me and abides in My supreme abode. \\n(7.18) After many births the enlightened one resorts to Me by realizing that everything is, indeed, My manifestation. Such a great \\nsoul is very rare. (7.19) Persons whose judgement has been carried away by various desires, impelled by their Karmic impression \\n(Samskara), resort to celestial controllers and practice various religious rites. (7.20) \\nGod can be seen in any image of worship\\nWhosoever desires to worship whatever deity (using any \\nname, form, and method) with faith, I make their faith steady in that \\nvery deity. Endowed with steady faith, they worship that deity and \\nfulfil their wishes through that deity. Those wishes are, indeed, \\ngranted only by Me. (7.21-22) Such material gains of these less \\nintelligent human beings are temporary. The worshipers of celestial controllers go to celestial controllers, but My devotees certainly \\ncome to Me. (7.23) \\nThe ignorant ones — unable to understand My immutable, incomparable, incomprehensible and transcendental form, assume \\nthat I am formless and take form just as humans do. (7.24) Concealed by My divine power (Maya), I do not reveal Myself to the \\nignorant ones, who do not know and understand My unborn, eternal, transcendental form and personality — and consider Me formless! (7.25) \\nI know, O Arjuna, the beings of the past, of the present, and \\nthose of the future, but no one really knows Me. (7.26) All beings \\nin this world are in utter ignorance due to delusion of pairs of opposites born of likes and dislikes, O Arjuna. But persons of unselfish deeds, whose Karma or sin has come to an end, become free \\n\\n\\nfrom the delusion of pairs of opposites and worship Me with firm \\nresolve. (7.27-28) Those who strive for freedom from the cycles of \\nbirth, old age, and death by taking refuge in Me; fully comprehend \\nEternal Being, the nature of Eternal Being, and Karma, the power \\nof Eternal Being. (7.29) The steadfast persons who know Me as \\neverything: The mortal beings, temporal Divine Beings, the Supersoul, even at the time of death, attain Me. (7.30)\\nCHAPTER 8\\n8. The eternal being, God\\nArjuna said: O Krishna, who is the Eternal Being? What is the \\nnature of the Eternal Being? What is Karma? Who are the mortal \\n\\nbeings? And who are Divine Beings? Who is the Supersoul, and \\nhow does He dwell in the body? How can You be remembered at \\nthe time of death by those who have control over their minds, O \\nKrishna? (8.01-02)\\nDefinitions of supreme spirit, spirit, individual soul\\nThe Supreme Lord said: The immutable Spirit is called Eternal \\nBeing or God. The nature, including the inherent power of cognition \\nand desire, of God is called Adhyatma. The creative power of God\\nthat causes manifestation of living entities is called Karma. (8.03) \\nMortal beings are called Adhibhuta. The expansions of Divine Personality are called Divine Beings. I am the Supersoul residing inside every cell of living beings as the supreme controller, O Arjuna. \\n(8.04)\\nTheory of reincarnation and Karma\\nThe one who remembers Me exclusively, even while leaving \\nthe body at the time of death, attains Me; there is no doubt about \\nit. (8.05) Remembering whatever object one leaves the body at the \\nend of life, one attains that object, O Arjuna. Because of the constant thought of that object, one remembers that object at the end \\nof life and achieves it. (8.06)\\nA simple method of God-realization\\nTherefore, always remember Me and do your duty. You shall \\ncertainly attain Me if your mind and intellect are ever focused on \\nMe. (8.07) By contemplating on Me with an unwavering mind that \\nis disciplined by the practice of meditation, one attains the Supreme Being, O Arjuna. (8.08) One who meditates on the Supreme \\nBeing — as the omniscient, the oldest, the controller, smaller than \\nthe smallest and bigger than the biggest, sustainer of everything, \\nthe inconceivable, self-luminous like the sun, and beyond material \\nreality — at the time of death with steadfast mind and devotion; \\nmaking the flow of bioimpulses (life forces, Prana) rise up to the \\nmiddle of two eye brows (or the sixth Chakra) by the power of yoga \\nand holding there, attains the Supreme Divine Person. (8.09-10) I \\nshall briefly explain the process to attain the supreme abode that \\nthe knowers of the Veda call immutable; into which the ascetics, \\nfreed from attachment, enter; and desiring which, people lead a life \\nof celibacy. (8.11) \\nAttain salvation by meditating on God\\nWhen one leaves the physical body by controlling all the \\nsenses, focusing the mind on God, engaged in yogic practice, \\nmeditating on Me and uttering OM — the sacred monosyllable \\nsound power of Eternal Being — one attains the supreme abode. \\n(8.12-13) I am easily attainable, O Arjuna, by that ever steadfast \\nyogi who always thinks of e and whose mind does not go elsewhere. (8.14) After attaining Me, the great souls do not incur rebirth \\nin this miserable transitory world because they have attained the \\nhighest perfection. (8.15) The dwellers of all the worlds — up to \\nand including the world of Brahma, the creator — are subject to the \\nmiseries of repeated birth and death. But, after attaining Me, O Arjuna, one does not take birth again. (8.16)\\nEverything in the creation is cyclic\\nThose who know that the day of the creator (Brahma) lasts one \\nthousand Yugas (or 4.32 billion solar years) and that his night also \\nlasts one thousand Yugas, they are the knowers of day and night. \\n(8.17) All manifestations come out of the primary material Nature \\n(Adi-Prakriti) at the arrival of the day of Brahma, the Creative \\nPower, and they again merge into the same at the coming of \\nBrahma’s night. (8.18) The same multitude of beings comes into \\nexistence again and again at the arrival of the day of the creator \\n(Brahma); and are annihilated, inevitably, at the arrival of Brahma’s \\nnight. (8.19) \\nThere is another eternal existence — higher than the changeable material Nature (Prakriti) — that does not perish when all created beings perish. This is called the Eternal Being. This is also \\nsaid to be the supreme abode. Those who attain My supreme \\nabode do not take birth again. (8.20-21) This supreme abode, O \\nArjuna, is attainable by unswerving devotion to Me, within which all \\nbeings exist and by which all this universe is pervaded. (8.22) \\nTwo basic paths of departure after death\\nO Arjuna, now I shall describe different paths departing by \\nwhich, after death, the yogis do or do not come back. (8.23) Passing gradually, after death, through celestial controllers of fire, light, \\ndaytime, the bright lunar fortnight, and the six months of the northern solstice of the sun, yogis who know the Self attain supreme \\nabode and do not come back to earth. (8.24) Passing gradually, \\nafter death, through celestial controllers of smoke, night, the dark \\nlunar fortnight, and the six months of southern solstice of the sun, \\nthe righteous person attains heaven and comes back to earth \\nagain. (8.25) The path of light of Self-knowledge and the path of \\n\\n\\ndarkness of ignorance are thought to be the world’s two eternal \\npaths. The former leads to salvation (Mukti, Nirvana), and the latter \\nleads to rebirth. (8.26) \\nSpiritual knowledge leads to salvation\\nKnowing these two paths, O Arjuna, a yogi is not bewildered at \\nall. Therefore, O Arjuna, be steadfast in yoga (union) with Me at all \\ntimes. (8.27) The yogi who knows all this goes beyond getting the \\nbenefits of the study of the Vedas, performance of sacrifices, austerities, and charities, and attains My Supreme Eternal Abode. \\n(8.28) \\n\\nCHAPTER 9\\n9. Supreme knowledge and the big mystery\\nThe Supreme Lord said: I shall reveal to you, who do not disbelieve, the most profound, secret, spiritual knowledge, together \\nwith spiritual experience. Knowing this, you will be freed from the \\nmiseries of worldly existence. (9.01) \\nKnowledge of the supreme is the biggest mystery\\nThis Self-knowledge is the king of all knowledge, is the most \\nsecret, is very sacred, can be perceived by instinct, conforms to \\nrighteousness (Dharma), is very easy to practice, and is timeless. \\n(9.02) O Arjuna, those who have no faith in this knowledge do not \\nattain Me and follow the cycles of birth and death. (9.03) This entire \\nuniverse is an expansion of Mine. All beings depend on Me. I do \\nnot depend on them, because I am the highest of all. (9.04) Look \\nat the power of My divine mystery; in reality, I — the sustainer and \\ncreator of all beings — do not depend on them, and they also do \\nnot depend on Me. (9.05) \\nNOTE: It’s like a gold-chain depends on gold, and milk products depend on milk. In fact, the gold-chain does not depend on \\ngold; the chain is nothing but gold! Similarly, matter and energy are \\ndifferent as well as non-different.\\nPerceive that all beings remain in Me, without any connection\\nor contact, as the mighty wind, moving everywhere in the sky, eternally remains in space. (9.06) \\nThe theory of evolution and involution\\nAll beings merge into My Adi-Prakriti (primary material Nature) \\nat the end of a cycle of just over 311 trillion solar years, O Arjuna, \\nand I create them again at the beginning of the next cycle. (9.07) I \\ncreate the entire multitude of beings again and again with the help \\nof My material Nature. These beings are under control of the three \\nmodes of material Nature. (9.08) These acts of creation do not bind \\nMe, O Arjuna, because I remain indifferent and unattached to those \\nacts. (9.09) The divine kinetic energy (Maya) — with the help of \\nmaterial Nature — creates all animate and inanimate objects under \\nMy supervision; thus, the creation keeps on going, O Arjuna. (9.10) \\nThe ways of the wise and of the ignorant\\nIgnorant persons hate Me when I appear in human form because they do not know My spiritual nature as the great Lord of all \\nbeings and take Me for an ordinary human. They have false hopes, \\nfalse actions, false knowledge, and delusive qualities (See 16.04-\\n18) of fiends and demons and are unable to recognize Me. (9.11-\\n12) But great souls, O Arjuna, who possess divine qualities (See \\n16.01-03), know Me as immutable, as both the material and efficient cause of creation, and worship Me single-mindedly with loving devotion. (9.13) Persons of firm resolve worship Me with ever \\nsteadfast devotion by always singing My glories, striving to attain \\nMe, and prostrating before Me with devotion. (9.14) Some worship \\nMe by acquiring and propagating Self-knowledge. Others worship \\nthe infinite as the One in all (or non-dual), as the master of all (or \\ndual), and in various other ways. (9.15) \\nEverything is a manifestation of God\\nI am the ritual, I am the sacrifice, I am the offering, I am the \\nherb, I am the mantra, I am the clarified butter, I am the fire, and I \\nam the oblation. I am the supporter of the universe, the father, the \\nmother, and the grandfather. I am the object of knowledge, the sacred syllable ‘OM’, and also the Vedas. I am the goal, the supporter, the Lord, the witness, the abode, the refuge, the friend, the \\norigin, the dissolution, the foundation, the substratum, and the immutable seed. (9.16-18) I give heat. I send, as well as withhold, the \\nrain. I am immortality, as well as death. I am also both the absolute \\nand the temporal, O Arjuna. (9.19)\\nThe Supreme Being has become everything!\\nAttaining salvation by devotional love\\nThe performers of rituals prescribed in the Vedas, the drinkers \\nof the nectar of devotion, whose sins are cleansed, worship Me by \\ndoing good deeds for gaining heaven. As a result of their meritorious deeds, they go to heaven and enjoy celestial sense pleasures. \\n(9.20) They return to the mortal world — after enjoying the wide \\nworld of heavenly pleasures — upon exhaustion of their good \\nKarma. Thus, following the ritualistic injunctions of the Vedas, persons working for the fruit of their actions take repeated birth and \\ndeath. (9.21) \\nI personally take care of both the material and spiritual welfare \\nof those ever-steadfast devotees who always remember and adore \\nMe with single-minded contemplation. (9.22) O Arjuna, even those \\ndevotees who worship the deities with faith, they also worship Me, \\nbut in an improper way. (9.23) Because I — the Supreme Being —\\nalone am the enjoyer of all sacrificial services and Lord of the universe. But people do not know My true, spiritual nature. Therefore, \\n\\n\\nthey fall into the repeated cycles of birth and death. (9.24) Worshippers of the deities go to the deities; worshippers of ancestors \\ngo to the ancestors, and worshippers of the ghosts go to the \\nghosts; but My devotees come to Me and are not born again. (9.25) \\nThe Lord accepts and eats the offering of love\\nWhosoever offers Me a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or water with devotion, I accept and eat the offering of devotion by the purehearted. (9.26) O Arjuna, whatever you do, whatever you eat, \\nwhatever you offer as oblation to the sacred fire, whatever charity \\nyou give, whatever austerity you perform, do all that as an offering \\nunto Me. (9.27) You shall become free from the bondage — good \\n\\nand bad — of Karma by this attitude of complete renunciation \\n(Samnyasa-yoga). Becoming liberated, you shall come to Me. \\n(9.28) \\nThere is no unforgivable sinner\\nThe Self is present equally in all beings. There is no one hateful \\nor dear to Me. But those who worship Me with love and devotion \\nare very close to Me, and I am also very close to them. (9.29) Even \\nif the most sinful person resolves to worship Me with singleminded, loving devotion; such a person must be regarded as a \\nsaint because of making the right resolution. (9.30)\\nThere are no unforgivable sins or sinners. The fire of \\nsincere repentance burns all sins. \\nSuch a person soon becomes righteous and attains everlasting \\npeace. Be aware, O Arjuna, that My devotee shall never perish or \\nfall down. (9.31) \\nThe path of devotional love is easier\\nAnybody — including women, merchants, laborers, and the \\nevil-minded — can attain the supreme abode by just surrendering \\nunto My will with loving devotion, O Arjuna. (9.32) It should then be \\nvery easy for holy priests and devout sages to attain the Supreme.\\nTherefore, having obtained this joyless and transitory human life, \\none should always worship Me with loving devotion. (9.33) Fix your \\nmind on Me, be devoted to Me, worship Me, and bow down to Me. \\nThus, uniting yourself with Me by setting Me as the supreme goal \\nand the sole refuge, you shall certainly come to Me. (9.34) \\nCHAPTER 10\\n10. Manifestation of the absolute\\nThe Supreme Lord said: O Arjuna, listen once again to My supreme word that I shall speak to you, who are very dear to Me, for \\nyour welfare. (10.01) \\nGod is the origin of everything\\nNeither the celestial controllers (Devas), nor the great sages \\nknow My origin because I am the origin of all Devas and great \\nsages also. (10.02) One who knows Me as the unborn, the beginningless, and the Supreme Lord of the universe, is considered wise \\namong the mortals and becomes liberated from the bondage of \\nKarma. (10.03) Intelligence, Self-knowledge, non-delusion, forgiveness, truthfulness, control over the mind and senses, tranquility, pleasure, pain, birth, death, fear, fearlessness, nonviolence, \\ncalmness, contentment, austerity, charity, fame, ill fame — these \\ndiverse qualities in human beings also arise from Me. (10.04-05) \\nThe seven great sages from whom all the creatures of the world \\nwere born, originated from My potential energy. (10.06) \\nOne who truly understands My manifestations and yogic powers, is united with Me by unswerving devotion. There is no doubt \\nabout it. (10.07) I am the origin of all. Everything emanates from \\nMe. Understanding this, the wise adore Me with love and devotion. \\n(10.08) My devotees remain ever content and delighted. Their \\nminds remain absorbed in Me and their lives surrendered unto Me. \\nThey always enlighten each other by talking about Me. (10.09)\\nGod gives spiritual knowledge to His devotees\\nI give knowledge and understanding of metaphysical science \\n— to those who are ever united with Me and lovingly adore Me —\\nby which they come to Me. (10.10) I, who dwell within their inner \\npsyche as consciousness, destroy the darkness born of ignorance \\nby the shining lamp of spiritual knowledge as an act of compassion \\nfor them. (10.11) Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Being, the Supreme Abode, the Supreme Purifier, the Eternal Divine Being, the \\nprimal God, the unborn, and the omnipresent. All sages have thus\\nacclaimed You. And now You Yourself tell me that. (10.12-13) \\nNobody can know the real nature of Reality\\nO Krishna, I believe all that You have told me to be true. O \\nLord, neither the celestial controllers nor the demons fully understand Your real nature. (10.14) O Creator and Lord of all beings, \\nGod of all celestial rulers, Supreme person, and Lord of the universe, You alone know Yourself by Yourself. (10.15) Therefore, \\nYou alone are able to fully describe Your own divine manifestations \\nby which You exist pervading all the universes. (10.16) How may I \\nknow You, O Lord, by constant contemplation? In what form of \\nmanifestation am I to think of You, O Lord? (10.17) O Lord, explain \\nto me again, in detail, Your yogic power and glory because I am \\nnot satiated by hearing Your nectar-like words. (10.18)\\nEverything is a manifestation of the Absolute\\nThe Supreme Lord said: O Arjuna, now I shall explain to you \\nMy prominent divine manifestations because My manifestations \\nare endless. (10.19) O Arjuna, I am the Spirit abiding in the inner \\npsyche of all beings. I am also the beginning, the middle, and the \\nend of all beings. (10.20) I am the sustainer, I am the radiant sun \\namong the luminaries, I am the supernatural controllers of wind, I \\nam the moon among the stars. (10.21) I am the Vedas, I am the \\n\\n\\ncelestial rulers, I am the mind among the senses, I am the consciousness in living beings. (10.22) I am Lord Shiva, I am the god \\nof wealth, I am the god of fire, and the mountains. (10.23) I am the \\npriest and the army general of the celestial controllers, O Arjuna. I \\nam the ocean among the bodies of water. (10.24) I am sage Bhrigu \\namong the great sages; I am the monosyllable cosmic sound, OM\\n, Amin, Allah among the words; I am the silent repetition of mantra \\n(Japa) among the spiritual disciplines; and I am the Himalaya \\namong the mountains. (10.25)\\nA brief description of divine manifestations\\n\\nI am the holy fig tree among the trees, and I am all other celestial rulers. (10.26) Know Me as the celestial animal among the animals and the King among men. I am the thunderbolt among weapons, and I am Cupid for procreation. (10.27-28) I am the water god \\nand the manes. I am the controller of death. I am death among the \\nhealers, lion among the beasts, and the king of birds among birds. \\n(10.29-30) I am the wind among the purifiers and Lord Rama \\namong the warriors. I am the crocodile among the fishes and the \\nholy Ganga river among the rivers. (10.31) \\nI am the beginning, the middle, and the end of all creation, O \\nArjuna. Among knowledge I am knowledge of the supreme Self. I \\nam logic of the logician. (10.32) I am the letter ‘A’ among the alphabets. I am the dual compound among the compound words. I \\nam the endless time. I am the sustainer of all, and have faces on \\nall sides (or I am omniscient). (10.33) I am the all-devouring death \\nand also the origin of future beings. I am the seven goddesses or \\nguardian angels presiding over the seven qualities: Fame, prosperity, speech, memory, intellect, resolve, and forgiveness. (10.34) \\nI am the Vedic hymns. I am Gayatri mantra among the Vedic mantras. I am November-December among the months, I am the spring \\namong the seasons. (10.35) I am gambling of the cheats, splendor \\nof the splendid, victory of the victorious, resolution of the resolute, \\nand goodness of the good. (10.36) \\nI am Krishna, Arjuna, sage Vyasa among the sages, and \\nUshana among the great poets. (10.37) I am the power of rulers, \\nthe statesmanship of the seekers of victory, I am silence among \\nthe secrets, and the Self-knowledge of the knowledgeable. (10.38) \\nI am the origin of all beings, O Arjuna. There is nothing, animate or \\ninanimate, that can exist without Me. (10.39) \\nCreation is a small part of the Absolute\\nThere is no end of My divine manifestations, O Arjuna. This is \\nonly a brief description by Me of the extent of My divine manifestations. (10.40) Whatever is endowed with glory, brilliance, and \\npower — know that to be a manifestation of a very small fraction of \\nMy splendor. (10.41) What is the need for this detailed knowledge, \\nO Arjuna? I continually support the entire universe by a small fraction of My divine power, Maya. (10.42) \\nCHAPTER 11\\n11. Vision of the universal form\\nArjuna said: My illusion is dispelled by the profound words of \\nwisdom You spoke out of compassion for me about the supreme \\nsecret of Eternal Being. (11.01) O Krishna, I have heard from You \\nin detail about the origin and dissolution of beings and Your immutable glory. (11.02) \\nThe vision of God is the ultimate aim of a seeker\\nO Lord, You are as You have said, yet I wish to see Your divine \\ncosmic form, O Supreme Being. (11.03) O Lord, if You think it is \\npossible for me to see Your universal form, then, O Lord of the \\nyogis, show me Your transcendental form. (11.04) The Supreme \\nLord said: O Arjuna, behold My hundreds and thousands of multifarious divine forms of different colors and shapes. Behold all the \\ncelestial beings and many wonders never seen before. Also behold \\nthe entire creation — animate, inanimate, and whatever else you \\nwould like to see — all at one place in My body. (11.05-07) But you \\nare not able to see Me with your physical eye; therefore, I give you \\nthe divine eye to see My majestic power and glory. (11.08)\\nLord Krishna shows His cosmic form \\nSanjaya said: O King, having said this, Lord Krishna, the great \\nLord of the mystic power of yoga, revealed His supreme majestic \\nform to Arjuna. (11.09) Arjuna saw the Universal Form of the Lord \\nwith many mouths and eyes, and many marvelous visions with numerous divine ornaments, holding many divine weapons, wearing \\ndivine garlands and apparel, anointed with celestial perfumes and \\nointments, full of all wonders — the limitless God with faces on all \\nsides. (11.10-11) If the splendor of thousands of suns were to blaze \\nforth all at once in the sky, even that would not resemble the splendor of that exalted being. (11.12) Arjuna saw the entire universe, \\ndivided in many ways, but standing as all in One in the transcendental body of Krishna, the Lord of celestial rulers. (11.13) \\nOne may not be prepared or qualified to see God\\nUpon seeing the cosmic form of the Lord, Arjuna was filled with \\nwonder; and his hairs standing on end, bowed his head to the Lord \\nand prayed with folded hands. (11.14) Arjuna said: O Lord, I see in \\nYour body all supernatural controllers and multitudes of beings, all \\nsages, celestial serpents, Lord Shiva, as well as Lord Brahma\\nseated on the lotus. (11.15) O Lord of the universe, I see You everywhere with infinite forms, with many arms, stomachs, faces, and \\neyes. O Universal Form, I see neither your beginning nor the middle nor the end. (11.16) I see You with crown, club, \\n\\ndiscus, and \\nmassive radiance, difficult to behold, shining all around like the immeasurable brilliance and blazing fire of the sun. (11.17)\\nI believe You are the Supreme Being to be realized. You are the \\nultimate resort of the universe. You are the Eternal Being and protector of the eternal order (Dharma). (11.18) I see You with infinite \\npower, without beginning, middle, or end; with many arms; with the \\nsun and the moon as Your eyes; with Your mouth as a blazing fire, \\nscorching all the universe with Your radiance. (11.19) O Lord, the \\nentire space between heaven and earth in all directions is pervaded by You. Seeing Your marvelous and terrible form, the three \\nworlds are trembling with fear. (11.20) Hosts of supernatural rulers \\n\\nenter into You. Some with folded hands sing Your names and glories in fear. A multitude of perfected beings hail and adore You with \\nabundant praises. (11.21) All the celestial beings amazingly gaze \\nat You. Seeing your infinite form with many mouths, eyes, arms, \\nthighs, feet, stomachs, and many fearful tusks; the worlds are trembling with fear, and so do I, O mighty Lord. (11.22-23)\\nArjuna is frightened to see the Cosmic form\\nSeeing Your effulgent and colorful form touching the sky; Your \\nmouth wide open and large shining eyes; I am frightened and find \\nneither peace nor courage, O Krishna. (11.24) Seeing Your mouths \\nwith fearful tusks, glowing like fires of cosmic dissolution, I lose my \\nsense of direction and find no comfort. Have mercy on me, O Lord \\nof celestial rulers, refuge of the universe! (11.25) All my cousin \\nbrothers, along with the hosts of other kings and warriors of the \\nother side, together with chief warriors on our side, are also quickly \\nentering into Your fearful mouths with terrible tusks. Some are \\nseen caught in between the tusks with their heads crushed. (11.26-\\n27) These warriors of the mortal world are entering Your blazing \\nmouths as many torrents of the rivers enter into the ocean. (11.28) \\nAll these people are rapidly rushing into Your mouths for destruction as moths rush with great speed into the blazing flame for destruction. (11.29) You are licking up all the worlds with Your flaming \\nmouths, swallowing them from all sides. Your powerful radiance is \\nfilling the entire universe with effulgence and burning it, O Krishna. \\n(11.30) Tell me who You are in such a fierce form? My salutations \\nto You, O best of all celestial rulers, be merciful! I wish to understand You, O primal Being, because I do not know Your mission. \\n(11.31) \\nWe are only a divine instrument\\nThe Supreme Lord said: I am death, the mighty destroyer of \\nthe world. I have come here to destroy all these people. Even without your participation in the war, all the warriors standing arrayed \\nin the opposing armies shall cease to exist. (11.32) Therefore get \\nup and attain glory. Conquer your enemies, and enjoy a prosperous kingdom. All these warriors have already been destroyed by \\nMe. You be a mere My instrument, O Arjuna. (11.33)\\nThis is My battle, not yours. I use you, O Arjuna, only as an \\ninstrument. I do everything through your body. One must \\nremember at all times that all battles are His, not ours. The will and \\npower of God do everything.\\nKill all these great warriors who are already killed by Me. Do \\nnot fear. You will certainly conquer the enemies in the battle; therefore, fight! (11.34) \\nArjuna’s prayers to the Cosmic form\\nSanjaya said: Having heard these words of Krishna, the \\ncrowned Arjuna, trembling with folded hands, prostrated with fear \\nand spoke to Krishna in a choked voice. (11.35) Arjuna said: \\nRightly, O Krishna, the world delights and rejoices in glorifying You. \\nTerrified demons flee in all directions. The hosts of perfected ones \\nbow to You in adoration. (11.36) Why should they not — O great \\nsoul — bow to You, the original creator who is even greater than \\nBrahma, the creator of material worlds? O infinite Lord, O God of \\nall celestial rulers, O abode of the universe, You are both Sat (eternal) and Asat (temporal), and the Supreme Being that is beyond \\nboth Sat and Asat. (11.37) \\nYou are the primal God, the most ancient Person. You are the \\nultimate resort of all the universe. You are the knower, the object \\nof knowledge, and the supreme abode. The entire universe is pervaded by You, O Lord of the infinite form. (11.38) You are the controller of death, the fire, the wind, the water god, the moon god, and \\nBrahma, the creator, as well as the father of Brahma. Salutations \\nto You a thousand times, and again and again salutations to You. \\n(11.39) My salutations to You from front and from behind. O Lord, \\nmy obeisance to You from all sides. You are infinite valor and \\nboundless might. You pervade everything; therefore, You are everywhere and in everything. (11.40) \\nConsidering You merely as a friend, and not knowing Your \\ngreatness, I have inadvertently addressed You as O Krishna, O \\nYadava, O friend, etc., merely out of affection or carelessness. \\n(11.41) In whatever way I may have insulted You in jokes while \\nplaying, reposing in bed, sitting, or at meals; when alone or in front \\nof others, O Krishna, the immeasurable One, I implore You for forgiveness. (11.42) You are the father of this animate and inanimate \\nworld, and the greatest Guru to be worshipped. No one is even \\nequal to You in the three worlds; how can there be one greater than \\nYou, O Being of incomparable glory? (11.43)\\nTherefore, O adorable Lord, I seek Your mercy by bowing down \\nand prostrating my body before You. Bear with me as a father to \\nhis son, as a friend to a friend, and as a husband to his wife, O \\nLord. (11.44) I am delighted by beholding that which has never \\n\\n\\nbeen seen before, and yet my mind is tormented with fear. Therefore, O God of celestial rulers, the refuge of the universe, have\\nmercy on me and show me Your four-armed form. (11.45)\\nOne may see God in any form \\nI wish to see You with a crown, holding mace and discus in \\nYour hand. Therefore, O Lord, with thousand arms and universal \\nform, please appear in the four-armed form. (11.46) The Supreme \\nLord said: O Arjuna, being pleased with you I have shown you —\\nthrough My own yogic powers — this particular, supreme, shining, \\nuniversal, infinite, and primal form of Mine that has never been \\nseen before by anyone other than you. (11.47) O Arjuna, neither \\n\\nby study of the Vedas, nor by sacrifice, nor by charity, nor by rituals, nor by severe austerities, can I be seen in this cosmic form by \\nanyone other than you in this human world. (11.48) \\nDo not be perturbed and confused by seeing such a terrible form \\nof Mine as this. With fearless and cheerful mind, now behold My \\nfour-armed form. (11.49) Sanjaya said: After speaking like this to \\nArjuna, Lord Krishna revealed His four-armed form. And then assuming His pleasant human form, Lord Krishna, the Great One, \\nconsoled Arjuna who was terrified. (11.50) Arjuna said: O Krishna, \\nseeing this lovely human form of Yours, I have now become tranquil and I am normal again. (11.51) \\nGod can be seen by devotional love\\nThe Supreme Lord said: This (four-armed) form of Mine that \\nyou have seen is very difficult, indeed, to see. Even celestial controllers are ever longing to see this form. (11.52) This four-armed \\nform of Mine that you have just seen cannot be seen even by study \\nof the Vedas, or by austerity, or by acts of charity, or by the performance of rituals. (11.53) However, through single-minded devotion \\nalone, I can be seen in this form, can be known in essence, and \\nalso can be reached, O Arjuna. (11.54) One who dedicates all \\nworks to Me, and to whom I am the supreme goal, who is my devotee, who has no attachment, and is free from enmity towards any \\nbeing — attains Me, O Arjuna. (11.55)\\nCHAPTER 12\\n12. Path of devotion\\nWorship a personal or impersonal God?\\nArjuna said: Which of these has the best knowledge of yoga —\\nthose ever-steadfast devotees who worship You as Krishna, Your \\npersonal aspect, or those who worship Your impersonal aspect, \\nthe Eternal Being? (12.01) The Supreme Lord said: I consider the \\nbest yogis to be those ever-steadfast devotees who worship with \\nsupreme faith by fixing their mind on Me as their personal god. \\n(12.02) They also attain Me who worship the unchangeable, the \\ninexplicable, the invisible, the omnipresent, the inconceivable, the \\nunchanging, and the immovable Eternal Being; restraining all the \\nsenses, even minded under all circumstances, and engaged in the \\nwelfare of all creatures. (12.03-04)\\nReasons for worshipping a personal God\\nSelf-realization is more difficult for those who fix their mind on \\nthe impersonal, unmanifest, Eternal Being because comprehension of the unmanifest by human beings is attained with difficulty. \\n(12.05) But for those who worship Me with unswerving devotion as \\ntheir personal god, offer all actions to Me, intent on Me as the Supreme, and meditate on Me; I swiftly become their savior — from \\nthe world that is the ocean of death and transmigration — whose \\nthoughts are set on My personal form, O Arjuna. (12.06-07)\\nThe four paths to God\\nTherefore, focus your mind on Me, and let your intellect dwell \\nupon Me through meditation and contemplation. Thereafter, you \\nshall certainly attain Me. (12.08) If you are unable to focus your \\nmind steadily on Me, then long to attain Me, O Arjuna, by practice \\nof any other spiritual discipline that suits you. (12.09) If you are \\nunable even to do any spiritual discipline, then be intent on performing all your duty for Me. You shall attain perfection just by \\nworking for Me as an instrument, just to serve and please Me, without selfish motives. (12.10) If you are unable to work for Me, then \\njust surrender unto My will and renounce the attachment to and \\nanxiety for the fruits of all work with subdued mind — by learning \\nto accept all results, as God\\'s grace. (12.11)\\nKarma-yoga is the best Path\\nThe knowledge of scriptures is better than mere ritualistic practice; meditation is better than scriptural knowledge; renunciation of \\nattachment to the fruits of all work is better than meditation; peace \\nimmediately follows renunciation. (See more on renunciation in \\n18.02, 18.09) (12.12)\\nThe attributes of a devotee\\nOne who does not hate any creature, who is friendly and compassionate, free from the notion of \"I\" and \"my\", even-minded in \\npain and pleasure, forgiving; and the yogi who is ever content, who \\nhas subdued the mind, whose resolve is firm, whose mind and intellect are engaged in dwelling upon Me, who is devoted to Me —\\nis dear to Me. (12.13-14) The one by whom others are not agitated \\nand who is not agitated by others, who is free from joy, envy, fear, \\nand anxiety is also dear to Me. (12.15) One who is desireless, pure, \\nwise, impartial, and free from anxiety; who has renounced the doership in all undertakings—such a devotee is dear to Me. (12.16) \\nOne who neither rejoices nor grieves, neither likes nor dislikes, \\nwho has renounced both the good and the evil, and is full of devotion—is dear to Me. (12.17) The one who remains the \\n\\nsame towards friend or foe, in honor or disgrace, in heat or cold, in pleasure \\nor pain; who is free from attachment; who is indifferent to censure \\nor praise, quiet, content with whatever one has, unattached to a \\nplace, a country, or a house; calm, and full of devotion — that person is dear to Me. (12.18-19)\\nOne should sincerely try to develop divine qualities \\nBut those faithful devotees are very dear to Me who set Me as \\ntheir supreme goal and follow—or just sincerely try to develop—\\nthe above mentioned nectar of moral values. (12.20)\\nCHAPTER 13\\n13. Creation and the creator\\n\\nThe theory of creation\\nThe Supreme Lord said: O Arjuna, this physical body, a miniature universe, may be called the creation. One who knows the creation is called the creator by the seers of truth. (13.01) O Arjuna, \\nknow Me to be the creator of all the creation. The true understanding of both the creator and the creation is considered by Me to be \\nthe spiritual or metaphysical knowledge. (13.02) What the creation \\nis, what it’s like, what its transformations are, where its source is, \\nwho that creator is, and what His powers are — hear all these from \\nMe in brief. (13.03) The seers have separately described the creation and the creator in different ways in the Vedic hymns, and also \\nin the conclusive and convincing verses of the Brahma-Sutra. \\n(13.04) The primary material Nature, cosmic intellect, \"I\" consciousness or ego, five basic elements, ten organs, mind, five \\nsense objects; and desire, hatred, pleasure, pain, the physical \\nbody, consciousness, and resolve — thus the entire field has been \\nbriefly described with its transformations. (13.05-06) \\nThe fourfold noble truth as means of Nirvana\\nHumility, modesty, nonviolence, forgiveness, honesty, service \\nto guru, purity of thought, word, and deed, steadfastness, self-control; and aversion towards sense objects, absence of ego; constant \\nreflection on pain and suffering inherent in birth, old age, disease, \\nand death; (13.07-08) detached attachment with family members, \\nhome, etc.; unfailing calmness upon attainment of the desirable \\nand the undesirable; and unswerving devotion to Me through single-minded contemplation, taste for solitude, distaste for social \\ngatherings and gossips; steadfastness in acquiring the knowledge \\nof Eternal Being, and seeing the omnipresent Supreme Being everywhere — this is said to be knowledge. That which is contrary to \\nthis is ignorance. (13.09-11)\\nGod can be described by parables only\\nI shall fully describe the object of knowledge — knowing which \\none attains immortality. The beginningless Supreme Being is said \\nto be neither eternal (Sat) nor temporal (Asat). (13.12) The Eternal \\nBeing has His hands, feet, eyes, head, mouth, and ears everywhere, because He is all-pervading and omnipresent. (13.13) He \\nis the perceiver of all sense objects without the physical sense organs; unattached, and yet the sustainer of all; devoid of three \\nmodes of material Nature, and yet the enjoyer of the modes of material Nature by becoming a living entity. (13.14) He is inside as \\nwell as outside all beings, animate and inanimate. He is incomprehensible because of His subtlety. And because of His omnipresence, He is very near, residing in one’s inner psyche, as well as far \\naway in His Supreme Abode. (13.15) He is undivided, and yet appears to exist as if divided in beings. He, the object of knowledge, \\nappears as: Brahma, the creator; Vishnu, the sustainer; and Shiva, \\nthe destroyer of all beings. (13.16) \\nThe Supreme Person is the source of all light. He is said to be \\nbeyond darkness of ignorance. He is the Self-knowledge, the object of Self-knowledge, and seated in the inner psyche as consciousness of all beings. He is to be realized by Self-knowledge. \\n(13.17) Thus, the creation as well as the knowledge and the object \\nof knowledge have been briefly described by Me. Understanding \\nthis, My devotee attains the supreme abode. (13.18)\\nA description of the supreme spirit, spirit, and jiva\\nKnow that both the material Nature and the Spiritual Being are \\nbeginningless. All manifestations and three states of mind and matter, called modes or Gunas, are born of Prakriti. Prakriti is said to \\nbe the cause of production of the physical body and the eleven \\norgans of perception and action. Purusha (Consciousness, Spirit) \\nis said to be the cause of experiencing pleasure and pain. (13.19-\\n20) Purusha enjoys three modes of material Nature (Prakriti) by \\nassociating with Prakriti. Attachment to the Gunas due to ignorance caused by previous Karma is the cause of birth of living entity\\n(jiva) in good and evil wombs. (13.21) \\nEternal Being (God, Spirit) in the body is also called the witness, \\nthe guide, the supporter, the enjoyer, the great Lord, and also the \\nSupreme Self. (13.22) They who truly understand Spiritual Being \\n(Purusha) and the material Nature (Prakriti) with its three modes \\n(Gunas) are not born again, regardless of their way of life. (13.23) \\nSome perceive the supersoul in their inner psyche through mind \\nand intellect that have been purified either by meditation or by metaphysical knowledge or by Karma-yoga. (13.24) \\nThe faith alone can lead to Nirvana\\nOthers, however, do not know the yoga of meditation, \\nknowledge, and work; but they perform deity worship with faith, as \\nmentioned in the scriptures by the saints and sages. They also \\ntranscend death by virtue of their firm faith in what they have heard. \\n(13.25) Whatever is born, animate or inanimate, know them to be \\n\\n\\nborn from the union of the matter and Spirit, O Arjuna. (13.26) \\nThe one who sees the same eternal Supreme Lord dwelling as \\nSpirit equally within all mortal beings, truly sees. (13.27) Because \\nof beholding one and the same Lord existing equally in every being, one does not injure anybody and thereupon attains the supreme abode. (13.28) One who perceives that all works are done \\nby the powers (Gunas) of material Nature (Prakriti) alone, and thus \\ndoes not consider oneself as the doer, that person truly understands. (13.29) The moment one discovers the diverse variety of \\nbeings and their ideas abiding in the Source and coming out from \\nHim alone, one attains the Supreme Being. (13.30)\\nAttributes of the spirit \\n\\nBecause of being beginningless and unaffectable by the three \\nmodes of material Nature, the eternal supersoul — even though \\ndwelling in the body as a living entity — neither does anything nor \\nbecomes tainted, O Arjuna. (13.31) Just as the all-pervading space \\nis not tainted because of its subtlety; similarly, Spirit, abiding in all \\nbodies, is not tainted. (13.32) Just as one sun illuminates the entire \\nworld; similarly, Eternal Being illumines or gives life to the entire \\ncreation, O Arjuna. (13.33) \\nThey attain the Supreme, who perceive the difference between \\nbody and spirit with the eye of Self-knowledge, and know the techniques — by using any one of the five paths: Selfless service, \\nKnowledge, Devotion, Meditation, and Surrender — of liberation of \\nthe living entity (Jiva) from the trap of divine illusory energy (Maya). \\n(13.34)\\nCHAPTER 14\\n14. Three modes (Gunas) of nature\\nThe Supreme Lord said: I shall further explain to you that supreme knowledge, the best of all knowledge, knowing which all the \\nsages have attained supreme perfection after this life. (14.01) They \\nwho have taken refuge in this spiritual knowledge attain unity with \\nMe and are neither born at the time of creation, nor afflicted at the \\ntime of dissolution. (14.02) \\nBeings are born from the union of spirit and matter\\nMy material Nature is the womb of creation wherein I place the \\nseed of consciousness from which all beings are born, O Arjuna. \\n(14.03) Whatever forms are produced in all different wombs, O Arjuna, the material Nature is their body-giving mother; and I am the \\nlife-giving father. (14.04)\\nHow three modes of material nature bind us\\nSattva or goodness; Rajas or passion, activity; and Tamas or \\nignorance, inertia — these three modes (Ropes, Gunas) of material Nature (Prakriti) fetter the eternal individual soul to the body, O \\nArjuna. (14.05) Of these, the mode of goodness is illuminating and \\ngood because it is pure. It fetters the living entity by attachment to \\nhappiness and knowledge, O sinless Arjuna. (14.06) Know that the \\nmode of passion is characterized by intense craving and is the \\nsource of desire and attachment. It binds the living entity by attachment to the fruits of work. (14.07) Know, O Arjuna, that the mode \\nof ignorance — the deluder of living entity — is born of inertia. It \\nbinds the living entity by carelessness, laziness, and excessive \\nsleep. (14.08) O Arjuna, the mode of goodness attaches one to \\nhappiness (of learning and knowing the Eternal Being); the mode \\nof passion attaches to intense action; and the mode of ignorance \\nattaches to inaction, laziness by covering Self-knowledge. (14.09) \\nCharacteristics of three modes of nature\\nGoodness prevails by suppressing passion and ignorance; \\npassion prevails by suppressing goodness and ignorance; and ignorance prevails by suppressing goodness and passion, O Arjuna. \\n(14.10) When the light of Self-knowledge illuminates all the senses \\nin the body, then it should be known that goodness is predominant. \\n(14.11) O Arjuna, when passion is predominant, greed, activity, undertaking of selfish work, restlessness, excitement, etc. arise. \\n(14.12) O Arjuna, when inertia is predominant, ignorance, inactivity, carelessness, delusion, etc. arise. (14.13) \\nThree modes are also the vehicles of transmigration \\nOne who dies when goodness dominates goes to heaven —\\nthe pure world of knowers of the Supreme. (14.14) One who dies \\nwhen passion dominates is reborn attached to action or the utilitarian type. One who dies in ignorance is reborn as a lower creature. \\n(14.15) The fruit of good action is said to be beneficial and pure; \\nthe fruit of passionate action is pain; and the fruit of ignorant action \\nis laziness. (14.16) Self-knowledge arises from the mode of goodness; greed arises from the mode of passion; and negligence, delusion, and slowness of mind arise from the mode of ignorance. \\n(14.17) They who are established in goodness go to heaven; passionate persons are reborn in the mortal world; and the ignorant, \\nabiding in the lowest mode of ignorance, go to lower planets or hell \\n(or take birth as lower creatures). (14.18)\\nAttain Nirvana after rising above three modes \\nWhen visionaries perceive no doer other than the three modes \\nof material Nature and know the Supreme, which is above and beyond these modes, then they attain salvation (Mukti). (14.19) When\\none rises above the three modes of material Nature that originate \\nin the body, one attains immortality or salvation (Mukti) and is freed \\nfrom the pains of birth, old age, and death. (14.20)\\nThe process of rising above three modes\\nArjuna said: What are the marks of those who have transcended the three modes of material Nature, and what is their \\n\\nconduct? How does one transcend these three modes of material Nature, O Lord Krishna? (14.21) The Supreme Lord said: One is said \\nto have transcended the modes of material Nature who neither \\nhates the presence of enlightenment, activity, and delusion; nor \\ndesires for them when they are absent; who remains like a witness \\nwithout being affected by the modes of material Nature; who stays \\nfirmly attached to the Lord without wavering — thinking that only \\nthe modes of material Nature are operating. (14.22-23) And one \\nwho depends on the Lord and is indifferent to pain and pleasure; \\nto whom a clod, a stone, and gold are alike; to whom the dear and \\nthe unfriendly are alike; who is of firm mind; who is calm in censure \\n\\nand in praise, and indifferent to honor and disgrace; who is impartial to friend and foe; and who has given up the sense of doership\\nand ownership. (14.24-25)\\nBonds of three modes can be cut by devotional love\\nOne who offers service to Me with love and unswerving devotion, rises above three modes of material Nature and becomes fit \\nfor Nirvana. (14.26) Because I am the basis of the immortal Eternal \\nBeing, of everlasting order (Dharma), and of the absolute bliss. \\n(14.27)\\nCHAPTER 15\\n15. The supreme being\\nCreation is like a tree created by of Maya\\nThe Supreme Lord said: Sages speak of the eternal banyan \\ntree that has its origin (or root) above in the Supreme Being and \\nbranches below in the cosmos, and whose leaves are the Vedic \\nhymns. One who understands this tree is a knower of the Vedas. \\n(15.01) The branches of this cosmic tree of Maya (Illusion) spread \\nall over the cosmos. The tree is nourished by three modes of material Nature; sense pleasures are its sprouts; and its roots of ego, \\nattachment and desire stretch below in the human world, causing \\nKarmic bondage. (15.02) \\nCut the tree of attachment to attain salvation\\nThe real form of this tree is not perceptible here on earth, nor \\nis its beginning, end, or existence. Having cut the firm roots — the \\nego and desires — of this tree by the mighty ax of Self-knowledge \\nand detachment; thus thinking: \"I take refuge in that very primal \\nperson from whom this primal manifestation comes forth\", seek \\nthat supreme abode from where one does not come back to the \\nmortal world again. (15.03-04) The wise reach that eternal goal, \\nwho are free from pride and delusion, who have conquered the evil \\nof attachment, who constantly dwell in the Supreme Self with all \\ndesires completely stilled, and who are free from dualities of pleasure and pain. (15.05) The sun does not illumine My supreme \\nabode, nor does the moon, nor the fire. Having reached there people attain permanent liberation (Mukti) and do not come back to \\nthis temporal world again. (15.06) \\nThe embodied soul is the enjoyer\\nThe eternal individual soul in the body of living beings is, indeed, My integral part. It associates with the six sensory faculties \\nof perception — including the mind — and activates them. (15.07) \\nJust as the air takes aroma away from the flower; similarly, the individual soul takes the six sensory faculties from the physical body \\nit casts off during death to the new physical body it acquires in reincarnation by the power of Karma. (15.08) The living entity (Jiva) \\nenjoys sense pleasures using six sensory faculties of hearing, \\ntouch, sight, taste, smell, and mind. The ignorant cannot perceive \\nJiva departing from the body, nor staying in the body and enjoying \\nsense pleasures by associating with the modes of material Nature. \\nBut those who have the eye of Self-knowledge can see it. (15.09-\\n10) The yogis, striving for perfection, behold the living entity (Jiva) \\nabiding in their inner psyche as consciousness, but the ignorant \\nand those whose inner psyche is not pure, even though striving, \\ndo not perceive Him. (15.11)\\nSpirit is the essence of everything\\nKnow that light energy to be Mine that comes from the sun and \\nillumines the whole world and is in the moon and in fire. (15.12) \\nNOTE: The light of the sun is a reflection of His radiance (RV \\n10.07.03). The knowers of the Supreme Being visualize \\neverywhere — in themselves, in every human being, and in the \\nwhole universe — that supreme cluster of light which is the source \\nof the visible world. \\nEntering the earth, I support all beings with My energy. Becoming the sap-giving moon, I nourish all the plants. (15.13) Becoming \\nthe digestive fire, I remain in the body of all living beings. Uniting \\nwith vital life forces, I digest all types of food. (15.14) And I am \\nseated in the inner psyche of all beings. Memory, Self-knowledge, \\nand removal of doubts and wrong notions (about the Eternal Being \\nby reasoning or in trance (Samadhi)) come from Me. I am to be \\nknown by the study of all the Vedas. I am, indeed, the author of the \\nVedanta and the knower of the Vedas. (15.15)\\nSupreme spirit, spirit and the created beings\\nThere are two entities in the cosmos: The temporal Divine Beings and the unchangeable Eternal Being. All created beings are \\nsubject to change, but the Eternal Being does not change. (15.16) \\nThe Supreme Being is beyond both the Temporal Divine Beings \\nand the Eternal Being. He is also called the Absolute, Reality, God, \\n\\n\\nthe Source, who sustains both the Temporal and the Eternal by \\npervading everything. (15.17) Because I am beyond both the Temporal and the Eternal, therefore I am known in this world and in the \\nVedas as the Supreme Being. (15.18) The wise, who truly understand Me as the Supreme Being, know everything and worship Me \\nwholeheartedly, O Arjuna. (15.19) Thus, I have explained this most \\nsecret science of Self-knowledge, O sinless Arjuna. Having understood this, one becomes enlightened; one’s all duties are accomplished; and the goal of human life is achieved, O Arjuna. (15.20) \\nCHAPTER 16\\n16. Divine and the demonic qualities\\nA list of divine qualities to be cultivated\\n\\nThe Supreme Lord said: Fearlessness, purity of the inner psyche, perseverance in the yoga of Self-knowledge, charity, senserestraint, sacrifice, study of the scriptures, austerity, honesty; nonviolence, truthfulness, absence of anger, renunciation, calmness, \\nabstinence from malicious talk, compassion for all creatures, freedom from greed, gentleness, modesty, absence of fickleness, \\nsplendor, forgiveness, fortitude, cleanliness, absence of malice, \\nand absence of pride — these are the (twenty-six) qualities of \\nthose endowed with divine virtues, O Arjuna. (16.01-03)\\nA list of demonic qualities to be given up\\nO Arjuna, the marks of those who are born with demonic qualities are: Hypocrisy, arrogance, pride, anger, harshness, and ignorance. (16.04) Divine qualities lead to salvation (Moksha); the demonic qualities are said to be for bondage. Do not grieve, O Arjuna; \\nyou are born with divine qualities. (16.05) \\nThere are only two types of human beings\\nBasically, there are only two types of human beings in this \\nworld: The divine, and the demonic. The divine has been described \\nat length. Now hear from Me about the demonic, O Arjuna. (16.06) \\nPersons of demonic nature do not know what to do and what not \\nto do. They have neither purity nor good conduct nor truthfulness. \\n(16.07) They say that the world is unreal, without a substratum, \\nwithout God, and without an order. The world is caused by sexual \\nunion of man and woman alone and nothing else. (16.08) Adhering \\nto this wrong, atheistic view, these degraded souls — with small \\nintellect and cruel deeds — are born as enemies for the destruction \\nof the world. (16.09) Filled with insatiable desires, hypocrisy, pride, \\nand arrogance; holding wrong views due to delusion; they act with \\nimpure motives, (16.10) obsessed with endless anxiety lasting until \\ndeath, considering sense gratification their highest aim, and convinced that sense pleasure is everything; (16.11) \\nBound by hundreds of ties of desire and enslaved by lust and \\nanger, they strive to obtain wealth by unlawful means to fulfill sensual pleasures. They think: (16.12) This has been gained by me \\ntoday; I shall fulfill this desire; I have this much wealth and will have \\nmore wealth in the future; (16.13) that enemy has been slain by \\nme, and I shall slay others also. I am the lord. I am the enjoyer. I \\nam successful, powerful, and happy; (16.14)\\nI am rich and born in a noble family. Who is equal to me? I shall \\nperform sacrifice, I shall give charity, and I shall rejoice. (16.15) \\nThus deluded by ignorance, bewildered by many fancies, entangled in the net of delusion, addicted to the enjoyment of sensual \\npleasures, they fall into a foul hell. (16.16) Self-conceited, stubborn, filled with pride and intoxication of wealth, they perform sacrifice, charity, etc. only in name for show, and not according to \\nscriptural injunction. (16.17) These malicious people cling to egoism, power, arrogance, lust, anger, greed, hatred; and they deny \\nMy presence in their own body and in others’ bodies. (16.18) \\nSuffering is the destiny of the ignorant\\nI hurl these haters, cruel, sinful, and mean people into the cycles of rebirth in the womb of demons again and again. (16.19) O \\nArjuna, entering the wombs of demons, birth after birth, the deluded ones sink to the lowest hell without ever attaining Me. (16.20)\\nLust, anger, and greed are the three gates to hell\\nLust, anger, and greed are the three gates of hell leading to the \\nbondage of the individual. Therefore, one must learn to give up \\nthese three. (16.21) One who is liberated from these three gates of \\nhell, O Arjuna, does what is best and consequently attains the supreme abode. (16.22) \\nOne must follow the scripture\\nOne who acts under the influence of one’s desires, disobeying \\nscriptural injunctions, neither attains perfection nor happiness nor \\nthe supreme abode. (16.23) Therefore, let the scripture be your \\nauthority in determining what should be done and what should not \\nbe done. You should perform your duty following the scriptural injunction. (16.24) \\nCHAPTER 17\\n17. Threefold faith\\nArjuna said: What is the mode of devotion of those who perform \\nspiritual practices with faith, but without following the scriptural injunctions, O Krishna? Is it in the mode of goodness, passion, or \\nignorance? (17.01) \\nThree types of faith\\nThe Supreme Lord said: The natural faith of embodied beings \\nis of three kinds: Goodness, passion, and ignorance. Now hear \\nabout these from Me. (17.02) O Arjuna, the faith of each is in accordance with one’s own natural disposition governed by Karmic \\nimpressions. One is known by one’s faith. One can become whatever one wants to be — if one constantly contemplates the object \\nof desire with faith. (17.03) Persons in the mode of goodness worship celestial controllers; those in the mode of \\n\\npassion worship supernatural rulers and demons; and those in the mode of ignorance \\nworship ghosts and spirits. (17.04) Ignorant persons of demonic \\nnature are those who practice severe austerities without following \\nthe prescription of the scriptures, who are full of hypocrisy and egotism, who are impelled by the force of desire and attachment, and \\nwho senselessly torture the elements in their body and also Me \\nwho dwells within the body. (17.05-06)\\nThree types of food\\nThe food preferred by all of us is also of three types. So are the \\nsacrifice, austerity, and charity. Now hear the distinction between \\n\\nthem. (17.07) The foods that promote longevity, virtue, strength, \\nhealth, happiness, and joy are juicy, smooth, substantial, and nutritious. Such foods are liked by persons in the mode of goodness. \\n(17.08) People in the mode of passion like foods that are very bitter, sour, salty, hot, pungent, dry, and burning; and cause pain, \\ngrief, and disease. (17.09) People in the mode of ignorance like \\nfoods that are stale, tasteless, putrid, rotten, refuse, impure, such \\nas meat and alcohol. (17.10)\\nThree types of sacrifices\\nSelfless service — enjoined by the scriptures and performed \\nwithout a desire for the fruit, with a firm belief and conviction that it \\nis one’s duty — is in the mode of goodness. (17.11) Selfless service that is performed only for show and aiming for fruit — is in the \\nmode of passion, O Arjuna. (17.12) Selfless service that is performed without following the scripture, in which no food is distributed, which is devoid of mantra, faith, and gift, is said to be in the \\nmode of ignorance. (17.13)\\nAusterity of thought, word, and deed\\nThe worship of celestial controllers, the priest, the guru, and \\nthe wise; purity, honesty, celibacy, and nonviolence — these are \\nsaid to be austerity of deed. (17.14) Speech that is non-offensive, \\ntruthful, pleasant, beneficial, and is used for the regular study of \\nscriptures is called the austerity of word. (17.15) Serenity of mind, \\ngentleness, calmness, self-control, and purity of thought — these \\nare called austerity of thought. (17.16) \\nThree types of austerity\\nThe above mentioned threefold austerity — of thought, word, \\nand deed — practiced by yogis with supreme faith, without a desire \\nfor the fruit, is said to be in the mode of goodness. (17.17) Austerity \\nthat is performed for gaining respect, honor, reverence, and for the \\nsake of show, yielding an uncertain and temporary result, is said to \\nbe in the mode of passion. (17.18) Austerity performed with foolish \\nstubbornness or with self-torture or for harming others, is said to \\nbe in the mode of ignorance. (17.19)\\nThree types of charity\\nCharity that is given at the right place and time as a matter of \\nduty to a deserving candidate who does nothing in return, is considered to be in the mode of goodness. (17.20) Charity that is given \\nunwillingly, or to get something in return, or to gain some fruit, is \\nsaid to be in the mode of passion. (17.21) Charity that is given at a \\nwrong place and time to unworthy persons, or without paying respect to the receiver or with ridicule, is said to be in the mode of \\nignorance. (17.22)\\nThreefold name of God\\n‘OM TAT SAT’ is said to be the threefold name of God in Sanskrit. Persons with good qualities, the Vedas, and selfless service \\nwere created by God in the ancient time. (17.23) Therefore, acts of \\nsacrifice, charity, and austerity prescribed in the scriptures are always commenced by uttering ‘OM’ by the knowers of the Supreme \\nBeing. (17.24) Various types of sacrifice, charity, and austerity are \\nperformed by the seekers of salvation by uttering ‘TAT’ (or He is \\nall) without seeking a reward. (17.25) The word ‘SAT’ is used in the \\nsense of Reality and goodness. The word ‘SAT’ is also used for an \\nauspicious act, O Arjuna. (17.26) Faith in sacrifice, charity, and \\nausterity is also called ‘SAT’. Selfless service for the sake of the \\nSupreme is, in truth, termed as ‘SAT’. (17.27) Whatever is done \\nwithout faith — whether it is sacrifice, charity, austerity, or any \\nother act — is called ‘ASAT’. It has no value here or hereafter, O \\nArjuna. (17.28)\\nCHAPTER 18\\n18. Attaining liberation by giving up ego\\nArjuna said: I wish to know the nature of renunciation \\n(Samnyasa) and sacrifice (Tyaga) and the difference between the \\ntwo, O Lord Krishna. (18.01) \\nDefinition of renunciation and sacrifice\\nThe Supreme Lord said: The sages call renunciation the complete renunciation of work for any personal profit. The wise define \\nsacrifice as the sacrifice of, and the freedom from, attachment to \\nthe fruits of all work. (18.02) Some philosophers say that all work \\nis full of faults and should be given up, while others say that acts \\nof sacrifice, charity, and austerity should not be abandoned. \\n(18.03) \\nO Arjuna, listen to My conclusion about sacrifice. Sacrifice is \\nsaid to be of three types. (18.04) Acts of service, charity, and austerity should not be abandoned, but should be performed, because \\nservice, charity, and austerity are the purifiers of the wise. (18.05) \\nEven these obligatory works should be performed without attachment to the fruits. This is My definite supreme advice, O Arjuna.\\n(18.06) \\n\\n\\nThree types of sacrifice\\nGiving up one\\'s duty is not proper. The abandonment of obligatory work is due to delusion and is declared to be in the mode of \\nignorance. (18.07) One who abandons duty merely because it is \\ndifficult or because of fear of bodily affliction, does not get the benefits of sacrifice by performing such a sacrifice in the mode of passion. (18.08) Obligatory work performed as duty, renouncing attachment to the fruit, is alone to be regarded as sacrifice in the \\nmode of goodness, O Arjuna. (18.09) One who neither hates a disagreeable work, nor is attached to an agreeable work, is considered a sacrificer (Tyagi), imbued with the mode of goodness, intelligent, and free from all doubts about the Supreme Being. (18.10) \\nHuman beings cannot completely abstain from work. Therefore, \\n\\none who completely renounces attachment to the fruits of all work \\nis considered a Tyagi. (18.11) The threefold fruit of works — desirable, undesirable, and mixed — accrues after death to the one who \\nis not a Tyagi, but never to a Tyagi. (18.12)\\nFive causes of an action\\nLearn from Me, O Arjuna, the five causes, as described in the \\nSamkhya doctrine, for the accomplishment of all actions. They are: \\nthe physical body, the seat of Karma; the modes of material Nature, the doer; the eleven organs of perception and action, the instruments; various life forces; and the fifth is one’s fate. (18.13-14) \\nThese are the five causes of whatever action, whether right or \\nwrong, one performs by thought, word and deed. (18.15) Therefore, the ignorant, who consider one’s body or the soul as the sole \\nagent, do not understand due to imperfect knowledge. (18.16) One \\nwho is free from the notion of doership and whose intellect is not \\npolluted by the desire to reap the fruit — even after slaying all these \\npeople — neither slays nor is bound by the act of killing. (18.17) \\nThe subject, the object, and the knowledge of the object are the \\nthreefold driving force (or impetus) to an action. The eleven organs \\nof perception and action, the act, and the modes of Nature are the \\nthree components of action. (18.18)\\nThree types of spiritual knowledge\\nSelf-knowledge, action, and agent are said to be of three types, \\naccording to the Guna theory. Hear duly about these also. (18.19) \\nThe knowledge by which one sees a single immutable Reality in all \\nbeings as undivided in the divided, such knowledge is in the mode \\nof goodness. (18.20) The knowledge by which one sees different \\nrealities of various types among all beings as separate from one \\nanother; such knowledge is in the mode of passion. (18.21) The \\nirrational, baseless, and worthless knowledge by which one clings \\nto one single effect, such as the body, as if it is everything, such \\nknowledge is declared to be in the mode of darkness or ignorance \\n(18.22)\\nThree types of action\\nObligatory duty, performed without likes and dislikes and without selfish motives and attachment to enjoy the fruit, is said to be \\nin the mode of goodness. (18.23) Action performed with ego, with \\nselfish motives, and with too much effort, is in the mode of passion. \\n(18.24) Action that is undertaken because of delusion, disregarding consequences, loss, injury to others, as well as one’s own ability, is said to be in the mode of ignorance. (18.25)\\nThree types of person\\nA person who is free from attachment, is non-egotistic, endowed with resolve and enthusiasm, and unperturbed in success \\nor failure, is called good. (18.26) A person who is impassioned, \\nwho desires the fruits of work, who is greedy, violent, impure, and \\ngets affected by joy and sorrow, is called passionate. (18.27) A \\nperson who is undisciplined, vulgar, stubborn, wicked, malicious, \\nlazy, depressed, and procrastinating, is called ignorant. (18.28)\\nThree types of intellect\\nNow hear Me explain fully and separately, O Arjuna, the threefold division of intellect and resolve, based on modes of material \\nNature. (18.29) O Arjuna, that intellect is in the mode of goodness \\nwhich understands the path of work and the path of renunciation, \\nright and wrong action, fear and fearlessness, bondage and liberation. (18.30) That intellect is in the mode of passion which cannot \\ndistinguish between righteousness and unrighteousness, and right \\nand wrong action, O Arjuna. (18.31) That intellect is in the mode of \\nignorance which, when covered by ignorance, accepts unrighteousness as righteousness and thinks everything to be that which \\nit is not, O Arjuna. (18.32) \\nThree types of resolve, four goals of human life\\nThat resolve is in the mode of goodness by which one manipulates the functions of the mind, Prana (bioimpulses, life forces) \\nand senses for God-realization only, O Arjuna. (18.33) That resolve \\nis in the mode of passion by which one, craving for the fruits of \\nwork, clings to duty, earning wealth, and pleasure with great attachment. (18.34) That resolve is in the mode of ignorance by \\nwhich a dull person does not give up sleep, fear, grief, despair, and \\ncarelessness, O Arjuna. (18.35)\\nThree types of pleasure\\nAnd now hear from Me, O Arjuna, about the threefold pleasure. \\nThe pleasure that one enjoys from spiritual practice results in cessation of all sorrows. (18.36) The pleasure that appears as poison \\nin the beginning, but is like nectar in the end, comes by the grace \\nof Self-knowledge and is in the mode of goodness. (18.37) Sensual \\npleasures that appear as nectars in the beginning, but become poison in the end, are in the mode of passion. (18.38) Pleasure that \\nconfuses a person in the beginning and in the end as a result of \\nsleep, laziness, and carelessness, is in the mode of ignorance. \\n(18.39) There is no being, either on the earth or among the celestial \\ncontrollers in the heaven, who can remain free from these three \\n\\n\\nmodes of material Nature. (18.40) \\nDivision of labor is based on one’s ability\\nThe division of labor into four categories is also based on the \\nqualities inherent in people’s nature and not necessarily as one’s \\nbirth right, O Arjuna. (18.41) Intellectuals who have serenity, selfcontrol, austerity, purity, patience, honesty, spiritual knowledge, \\nspiritual experience, and belief in God are labeled as intellectuals \\n(Brahmans). (18.42) Those having the qualities of heroism, vigor, \\nfirmness, dexterity, steadfastness in battle, charity, and administrative skills are called Kshatriyas or warriors. (18.43) Those who \\n\\nare good at cultivation, cattle rearing, business, trade, and industry \\nare known as Vaishyas (merchants). Those who are very good in \\nservice and labor type work are classed as laborers. (18.44)\\nAttain salvation by duty, discipline, devotion\\nOne can attain the highest perfection by devotion to one’s natural work. Listen to Me how one attains perfection while engaged \\nin one’s natural work. (18.45) One attains perfection by worshipping the Supreme Being—from whom all beings originate, and by \\nwhom all this universe is pervaded — through performance of \\none’s natural duty for Him. (18.46) One’s inferior natural work is \\nbetter than superior unnatural work even though well performed. \\nOne who does the work ordained by one’s inherent nature without \\nselfish motives incurs no sin or Karmic bondage. (18.47) One’s \\nnatural work, even though defective, should not be abandoned because all undertakings are enveloped by defects as fire is covered \\nby smoke, O Arjuna. (18.48) The person whose mind is always free \\nfrom attachment, who has subdued the mind and senses, and who \\nis free from desires, attains the supreme perfection of freedom \\nfrom the bondage of Karma by renouncing attachment to the fruits \\nof work. (18.49) \\nLearn from Me briefly, O Arjuna, how one who has attained such \\nperfection — the freedom from the bondage of Karma — attains \\nthe Supreme Person, the goal of spiritual knowledge. (18.50) Endowed with purified intellect, subduing the mind with firm resolve, \\nturning away from sound and other objects of the senses, giving \\nup likes and dislikes; living in solitude; eating lightly; controlling the \\nmind, speech, and organs of action; ever absorbed in yoga of meditation; taking refuge in detachment; and relinquishing egotism, violence, pride, lust, anger, and proprietorship — one becomes \\npeaceful, free from the notion of \"I” and “my\", and fit for attaining \\noneness with the Supreme Being. (18.51-53) Absorbed in the Supreme Being, the serene one neither grieves nor desires. Becoming impartial to all beings, one obtains My Para-Bhakti, the highest \\ndevotional love. (18.54) By devotion one truly understands what \\nand who I am in essence. Having known Me in essence, one immediately merges with Me. (18.55) \\nA Karma-yogi attains the eternal immutable abode, by My grace \\n— even while doing all duties — just by dedicating all action to Me \\nwith loving devotion. (18.56) Sincerely offer all actions to Me, set \\nMe as your supreme goal, and completely depend on Me. Always \\nfix your mind on Me and resort to Karma-yoga. (18.57) When your \\nmind becomes fixed on Me, you shall overcome all difficulties by \\nMy grace. But, if you do not listen to Me due to ego, you shall perish. (18.58)\\nKarmic bondage and the free will\\nIf due to ego you think: I shall not fight, your resolve is vain. \\nBecause your own nature will compel you to fight. (18.59) O Arjuna, you are controlled by your own nature-born Karmic impressions (or Samskara). Therefore, you shall do — even against your \\nwill — what you do not wish to do out of delusion. (18.60) The Supreme Lord, Krishna or God, abiding as the controller in the inner \\npsyche of all beings, O Arjuna, causes them to evolve — or work \\nout their Karma — like a puppet of Karma, mounted on a machine. \\n(18.61) \\nThe Supreme Controller is the reflection of the Supreme \\nSpirit in the body. The Supreme Lord organizes, controls, \\nsupervises, and directs everything in the universe. Human being is \\nlike a puppet of Karma mounted on a body which is the vehicle of \\ntransmigration. The word evolve refers to working out one’s Karma. \\nThus we become the puppet of our own Karma created by our free \\nwill. \\nThe Lord has made Karmic laws as the controller of all \\nliving beings. Therefore, one must learn to gladly endure all that \\nfate imposes by taking refuge in God and following His\\ncommandments. Vedas declare that the Lord, using His law of \\nKarma, makes us dance as a juggler would make his monkey \\ndance. Without the laws of Karma; the scriptural injunctions, \\nprohibitions, as well as self-effort, would have no value at all. \\nKarma is the eternal justice and the eternal law. As a result of the \\nworking of eternal justice, there can be no escape from the consequences of our deeds. We become the product of our own past \\nthinking and action. Therefore, we must think and act wisely at the \\npresent moment, using the scriptures as a guide. \\nThe doctrine of Karma and reincarnation is also found in \\nthe following two verses of the Koran: Allah is He who created you \\nand then sustained you, then causes you to die, then gives life to \\nyou again (Surah 30.40). He may reward those who believe and \\ndo good works. No one is able to escape His law of consequences \\n(Surah 30.45). People cannot escape from the consequences of \\ntheir deeds, for as we sow, so we reap. Cause and effect cannot \\n\\n\\nbe separated because the effect exists in the cause as the fruit \\nexists in the seed. Good and evil deeds follow us continually like \\nour shadows. \\nThe Bible also says: Whosoever shedeth man’s blood, by \\nman shall his blood be shed (Genesis 9.06). It is believed that all \\nreferences to Karma and reincarnation were taken out of the Bible \\nduring the second century with the noble aim of encouraging \\npeople to strive hard for perfection during this very life. Those who \\nbelieve in reincarnation must avoid laziness and procrastination, \\nstress intense spiritual discipline, and try their best to get Self-\\n\\nrealization in this very life as if there were no reincarnation. Live as \\nthough this is your last day on this earth. One cannot achieve \\nanything through laziness and procrastination. \\nSeek refuge in the Supreme Lord alone with loving devotion, O \\nArjuna. By His grace you shall attain supreme peace and the Eternal Abode. (18.62) Thus, I have explained the knowledge that is \\nmore secret than the secret. After fully reflecting on this, do as you \\nwish. (18.63) \\nPath of surrender is the ultimate path to God\\nHear once again My most secret, supreme word. You are very \\ndear to Me; therefore, I shall tell this for your benefit. (18.64) Fix \\nyour mind on Me, be devoted to Me, offer service to Me, bow down \\nto Me, and you shall certainly reach Me. I promise you, because \\nyou are My very dear friend. (18.65) Setting aside doership, ownership and attachment to the fruits of all works, just surrender to—\\nor gladly abide by— My Will. I shall liberate you from all sins or \\nbondage of Karma. Do not grieve. (18.66) \\nThe meaning of abandoning all duties and taking refuge in \\nGod is that one should perform duty without ego and attachment\\nto results; as an offering to the Lord, and totally depend only on \\nHim. The Lord takes full responsibility for a person who totally depends on Him and understands: All is manifestation of the One.\\nThe highest service to God, and the best charity\\nThis knowledge should never be spoken by you to one who is \\ndevoid of austerity, who is without devotion, who does not desire \\nto listen, or who speaks ill of Me. (18.67) \\nTo speak of wisdom to a deluded person, to glorify sacrifice to \\na greedy person, to advise sense control to an irascible person, \\nand to discourse on Lord Rama’s exploits to a lecher, is as useless \\nas sowing seed on barren ground. It is not for any soul to believe, \\nsave by the permission of Allah. You should not compel one to \\nbelieve (Surah 10.100-101). Anyone to whom Allah has not \\ngranted the light (of knowledge) will have no light (Surah 24.40).\\nThe study of Gita or any other scripture is meant only for sincere \\npersons. According to Ramakrishna, one can understand Him as \\nmuch as He makes one understand. Guru Nanak said: O Beloved; \\nonly they to whom You give the divine knowledge, obtain it.\\nThe one who shall propagate (or help the propagation of) this \\nsupreme secret philosophy of the Gita amongst devotees, shall be \\nperforming the highest devotional service to Me and shall certainly \\ncome to Me. (18.68) No other person shall do a more pleasing service to Me, and no one on the earth shall be dearer to Me. (18.69)\\nThe Grace of the Gita\\nThose who shall study our sacred dialogue shall be performing \\na holy act of knowledge-sacrifice. This is My promise. (18.70) Whoever hears or reads this sacred dialogue in the form of the Gita with \\nfaith and without cavil becomes free from sin, and attains heaven \\n— the higher worlds of those whose actions are pure and virtuous. \\n(18.71) O Arjuna, did you listen to this with single-minded attention? Has your delusion born of ignorance been completely destroyed? (18.72) Arjuna said: By Your Grace my delusion is destroyed; I have gained Self-knowledge; my confusion with regard \\nto body and Spirit is dispelled; and I shall obey Your command. \\n(18.73) \\nSanjaya said: Thus, I heard this wonderful dialogue between \\nLord Krishna and Arjuna, causing my hair to stand on end. (18.74) \\nBy the grace of guru sage Vyasa, I heard this most secret and supreme yoga directly from Krishna, the Lord of yoga, Himself speaking to Arjuna before my very eyes of clairvoyance granted by sage \\nVyasa. (18.75) O King, by repeated remembrance of this marvelous and sacred dialogue between Lord Krishna and Arjuna, I am \\nthrilled at every moment, and (18.76) recollecting again and again, \\nO King, that marvelous form of Krishna I am greatly amazed, and \\nI rejoice over and over again. (18.77) \\nBoth spiritual knowledge and action are needed\\nWherever there will be both Krishna, the Lord of yoga (or \\nDharma in the form of the scriptures) and Arjuna with the weapons \\nof duty and protection, there will be everlasting prosperity, victory, \\nhappiness, and morality. This is my conviction. (18.78)\\nThus ends the Bhagavad-Gita\\nThis book is offered to the Lord of the Universe\\nMay He bless us all with Goodness.', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\Projects\\\\geeta_gpt\\\\docs\\\\geeta_text.txt'})]"
